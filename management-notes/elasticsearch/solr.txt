# Solr at scale for time oriented data

150B+ docs spanning 1 year (~= 500M a day) on 13 Big machines in EC2

## Sharding

Suggest don't shard time over the entire cluster.  Ever read would have to hit 
all shards.

Example given was sharding by day

He mentioned you still need to limit the time range - example given was 2 
months "haven't found a solution that's cheap where you can literally query 
the entire collection at once when you're talking about 150B docs"

Elasticsearch versus Database

Comes from the world of information retrieval (finding data, describing data) 
versus databases

Solr on HDFS (indexes on HDFS)

Backups

Adding a new field - have to reindex the entire collection!

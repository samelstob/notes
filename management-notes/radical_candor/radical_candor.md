# 2. Get, Give, and Encourage Guidance

"When you do that thing with your hand, I feel like you're ignoring what I'm
telling you.  I can see I am going to have to be really direct to get through
to you.  You are one of the samrtest people I know, but saying 'um' so much
makes you sound stupid.  The good news is a speaking coach can really help
with the 'um' thin.  The good news is a speaking coach can really help with
 'um' thing.  I know somebody who would be great.  You can definitely fix
this."

  - When it became clear that I wasn't hearing her, she became more direct,
    but even then she was careful not to "personalize", not to make it about
some essential trait.  She said I "sounded" stupid rather than I *was*
stupid.

* There are two dimensions to good guidance:
  - care personally
  - challenge directly

## It's not mean, it's clear

"I can see you really love your dog.  But that dog will die if you don't teach
her to sit!"
  Then, without asking for permission, the man bent down to Belvy, pointed his
finger at the sidewalk, and said with a loud, firm voice, "SIT!"
  She sat.  I gaped in amazement.
  He smiled and explained, "It's not mean.  It's clear!"

## Giving meaningful praise is hard

"I really admire that you are a Little League coach"

I realised later that my complimenet had not been specific - I adn't told Russ
why I admired that he was a coach.

"Well, the real problem is that I don't think you meant it - you hate sports"

Giving meaningful praise is hard.  That's why it's so important to guage your
guidance - to find how it lands for people.

## Obnoxious Aggression

Choosing between being a "nice incompetent" or a "competent asshole" is a
false dichotomy: you don't have to choose beteen those two extremes.  Time and
again, I have seen that it was kinder in the long run to be direct, even if
articulating my criticism caused some momentary upset ("It's not mean, it's
clear").

It's the fear of being labeled a jerk that pushes many people toward
Manipulative Insincerity of Ruinous Empath - both of which are actually worse
for their colleagues than Obnoxious Agression.

#Hiring Geeks That Fit

## Determine which roles you want to fill first

* Function-role chart
** suggests job title to fill function areas

* Look at your current team.  If they perform jobs that partially fill the
  areas you're trying to staff, include them on your interview team.

## Points to remember

* Know why you're hiring more people.
* Know what types of roles you require.
* Know that you need a risk-mitigation strategy if you can't find the people
  you need when you need them.
* Re-evaluate your hiring strategy periodically.

## Plan what you will do if you can't find the right people

You can choose one of several options

* Expand your search
* Change your hiring strategy e.g. fewer specific technical skills
* Choose which projects you're not going to do

## Use time, not money, to attract suitable candidates.

# Chapter 2. Analyze the Job

* Avoid laundry-list job descriptions - no one can fill a position.  Avoid
  short hand job descriptions - you may know what you want, but no one else
does.

* Analyze each open position.  Every time.  That way you know exactly what
  criteria you are hiring against.

1. Define the job's requirements, starting with the person's interactions and
   the type of work he or she will perform.

2. Define the activities and deliverables, the outcomes of the work you want
   the employee to perform.  This is a form of performance-based hiring.

3. Define both the essential and the desirable qualities, preferences,
   non-technical skills and technical skills.

4. Define the require education background and the desired level of technical
   experience.

5. Define the factors that could eliminate a candidate from consideration,
   including cultural fit.

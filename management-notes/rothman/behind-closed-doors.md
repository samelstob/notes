# Behind Closed Doors

## Week Five - Discovering Lurking Problems

* Not every problem is an individual problem.  Some problems are part of a
  system and can be solved only by a group of people.

* The people who perform the work need to be part of the solution.

* As a manager, you may need to facilitate their problem-solving work.  If the
  problem spans groups, you may need to work with your peers to solve problems
as part of a management team.

* These aren't stupid people; they aren't bad people either.  They're
  burnt-out people.  Burnout occurs when there is too much to do, not enough
time to do it, and the person attempts to do all the work anyway.

    - Working at a sustainable pace of 40 hours a week isn't molly-coddling.
      It's a smart business decision, and it's your job to make it happen.

    - Planning for a month works only if I don't have to take changes every
      couple of days.

    - Prioritizing features within a project or release is a business decision,
      not a technical decision.

* Recognize Messy Problems: Problems That Are Bigger Than One Manager Can Fix

    - Sometimes a problem that seems like it's coming from one person is
      actually a problem with the process.

* To detect whether it's bigger than one area:

    - Look for artificial constraints
    - Look for the root cause
    - Look for solutions that you can implement
    - Fix the problem, don't affix blame

### Solving Problems as a Management Team

Groups become teams when they realize they are interdependent, trust each
other, and have shared goals.

* Engage group creativity.  Prescribing solutions does not work.

* Describe the problem.  Start by describing what the issue is and how it
  affects members of the group to create a shared understanding of the problem

* Collect data.  Before you jump to solutions, collect some data.  Data
  collection doesn't have to be formal.  Look for quantitate and qualitative
data.

* Write it down.  Don't rely on memory.  Make the data visible.

* Brainstorm possible solutions.  It's tempting to stop with the first
  reasonable option that pops into your head.  Generating multiple options
leads to a richer understanding of the problem and potential solutions.

* Document the decision.

* Look for areas where you can act.  Even when a full solution involves areas
  outside your control, don't rely on others to start working on the issue.
Look for areas where you can act within your own department.

* Develop an action plan.  People don't implement solutions that don't have
  action plans.  Plan the steps, assign people and dates, track progress (Who
does what by when)

## Week Six - Building Capability

### Learning to Delegate

* Giving up technical work is difficult for many technical people because
  technical work fuels a sense of competence and satisfaction.  It's easier to
know when technical work is complete than to know when management work is
complete.

* Consider delegating an investment

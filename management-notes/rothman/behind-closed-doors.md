Behind Closed Doors
===================

Week Five - Discovering Lurking Problems
----------------------------------------

* Not every problem is an individual problem.  Some problems are part of a
  system and can be solved only by a group of people.

* The people who perform the work need to be part of the solution.

* As a manager, you may need to facilitate their problem-solving work.  If the
  problem spans groups, you may need to work with your peers to solve problems
as part of a management team.

* These aren't stupid people; they aren't bad people either.  They're
  burnt-out people.  Burnout occurs when there is too much to do, not enough
time to do it, and the person attempts to do all the work anyway.

    - Working at a sustainable pace of 40 hours a week isn't molly-coddling.
      It's a smart business decision, and it's your job to make it happen.

    - Planning for a month works only if I don't have to take changes every
      couple of days.

    - Prioritizing features within a project or release is a business decision,
      not a technical decision.

* Recognize Messy Problems: Problems That Are Bigger Than One Manager Can Fix

    - Sometimes a problem that seems like it's coming from one person is
      actually a problem with the process.

* To detect whether it's bigger than one area:

    - Look for artificial constraints
    - Look for the root cause
    - Look for solutions that you can implement
    - Fix the problem, don't affix blame

# Manage Your Project Portfolio Notes

## Forward

" Setting priorities is hard, but setting priorities and then resetting them
as the world changes, without being simply reactive to pressure, has a name.
It is management."

## 1. Meet Your Project Portfolio

### 1.3 Now Try This

* Concerns about using a portfolio
** Annoying others
** Not joined up with others
** Projects being parachuted in
** This weeks concern

# 2. See Your Future

" You may have loud discussions about which project really is number one.
And, as you work through those decisions, you'll discover that you are
performing the difficult work of leading the organization by deciding what to
do now, what to do later, and what not to do."

## 6. Collaborate on the Portfolio

### 6.6 How to Say No to More Work

Try these approaches

1. We Could Add More People

* "If we need to staff this project, we need more people"

2. 

### 8.3 Conduct a Portfolio Evaluation Meeting at Least Quarterly to Start

"I have not worked at an organization that could successfully evaluate the
portfolio every six months or even less frequently without missing too many
opportunities to manage which projects to commit to, to kill, or to transform"

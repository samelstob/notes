Manage It! - Notes
==================

Project manager:
The person whose job it is to articulate and communicate what 'done' means and
to guide the project team to done.  By 'done', I mean a product that meets the
needs of the organization developing the product and the customers who will
use the product.

## Manage Your Drivers, Constraints, and Floats

* What's driving the project?
* Are there constraints on the project?
* Can you trade off any of the drivers and constraints or buy yourself some
  more degrees of freedom?

The iron triangle is too simplisitic.  Successful project managers trade off
many more factors than what's in the iron triangle.

* First write down your customer's expectations - what's driving the project
  from your customers' perspective.
    - What they expect (feature set)
    - When (time to release)
    - How good (defect levels)

* Next write down the constraints you are under
    - Enviornment
    - Processes
    - Who do you have and what can they do
    - How much money do you have


* Driver
    Look at expectations and constraints.  What jumps out at you as being required
    for your project's success?
* Constraints
    * Which of the remaining items will you need to manage to make the project
      successful?
    * Create a hierarchy with these concerns being a little less critical than
      the driver
    * Choose 2 or 3
* Floats
    - Remaining items
    - Important to the project, but you have flexibility to manage them
    - 3 of them

# Decide on a Driver for Your Project

Early in the project, everything seems possible, especially if no one has
tried to estimate anything.

Don't say OK.  More likely, it's not possible to do everything your sponsor
wants in the time, for the money, with the people, and a the quality they
desire, given your work environment.  In that case, your sponsor needs to make
some hard decisions.

If sponsors don't decide, they push that decision down to the project manager.
If the PM doesn't decide, the team members will decide - and they will all
work to a different driver.

# Ranked list of possible drivers

Project priorities Rank
Cost to release     5
Release date        1
Feature set         2
Low defects         3
People              4
Work enviornment    6

In this project, the release date was the primary driver.  If we had missed
the release date this year, we would have lost all the value of the project.

# Context-Free Questions to Identify Project Drivers

High-level questions that help elicit other people's implicit assumptions
about the project.

* What does success look like?
* Why are these results desirable?
* What is the solution worth to you?
* What problems does this system solve?
* What problems could this system create?

* Why questions
    - The fewer "why" questions, the more you're learning about the business
      needs (and the less you soudn like an obnoxious two-year-old)
    - Why questions are morelikely to put the other person on the defensive
* How questions
    - Avoid "how" questions.  These sound like you're asking the sponsor to
      design the system.

Ask these questions out of a geniuine desire to know about the project, not to
put anyone on the defensive.  You can use these questions to lay the
groundwork for a useful collaboration with your sponsor, not a difficult
relationship.

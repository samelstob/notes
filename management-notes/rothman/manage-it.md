Manage It! - Notes
==================

# Starting a project

Project manager:

The person whose job it is to articulate and communicate what 'done' means and
to guide the project team to done.  By 'done', I mean a product that meets the
needs of the organization developing the product and the customers who will
use the product.

## Manage Your Drivers, Constraints, and Floats

* What's driving the project?
* Are there constraints on the project?
* Can you trade off any of the drivers and constraints or buy yourself some
  more degrees of freedom?

The iron triangle is too simplistic.  Successful project managers trade off
many more factors than what's in the iron triangle.

* First write down your customer's expectations - what's driving the project
  from your customers' perspective.
    - What they expect (feature set)
    - When (time to release)
    - How good (defect levels)

* Next write down the constraints you are under
    - Environment
    - Processes
    - Who do you have and what can they do
    - How much money do you have

* Driver
    Look at expectations and constraints.  What jumps out at you as being required
    for your project's success?
* Constraints
    * Which of the remaining items will you need to manage to make the project
      successful?
    * Create a hierarchy with these concerns being a little less critical than
      the driver
    * Choose 2 or 3
* Floats
    - Remaining items
    - Important to the project, but you have flexibility to manage them
    - 3 of them

Go back and do some juggling

"I've seen projects with up to three constraints succeed, but only with
extraordinary effort on the part of the project team.  In my experience, if
you have one driver, two constraints, and three floats, you have a resonable
chance of success.  The more floats you have, the easier it is to organize the
project."

## Decide on a Driver for Your Project

Early in the project, everything seems possible, especially if no one has
tried to estimate anything.

Don't say OK.  More likely, it's not possible to do everything your sponsor
wants in the time, for the money, with the people, and at the quality they
desire, given your work environment.  In that case, your sponsor needs to make
some hard decisions.

If sponsors don't decide, they push that decision down to the project manager.
If the PM doesn't decide, the team members will decide - and they will all
work to a different driver.

## Ranked list of possible drivers

Project priorities Rank
Cost to release     5
Release date        1
Feature set         2
Low defects         3
People              4
Work enviornment    6

In this project, the release date was the primary driver.  If we had missed
the release date this year, we would have lost all the value of the project.

## Context-Free Questions to Identify Project Drivers

High-level questions that help elicit other people's implicit assumptions
about the project.

* What does success look like?
* Why are these results desirable?
* What is the solution worth to you?
* What problems does this system solve?
* What problems could this system create?

* Why questions
    - The fewer "why" questions, the more you're learning about the business
      needs (and the less you sound like an obnoxious two-year-old)
    - Why questions are more likely to put the other person on the defensive
* How questions
    - Avoid "how" questions.  These sound like you're asking the sponsor to
      design the system.

Ask these questions out of a genuine desire to know about the project, not to
put anyone on the defensive.  You can use these questions to lay the
groundwork for a useful collaboration with your sponsor, not a difficult
relationship.

## Project Charter

### Vision

If you can't articulate the vision, chances are good that you're starting on
an impossible project.

## Know What Quality Means for Your Project

Understanding the project drivers, constraints, and floats is the first step
to understanding what quality means to your sponsors and customers.

* The sponsors are the people who are paying for the product
* The customers are the people who will use the product.

## Remember This

* Start every project with a charter
* Expect to iterate on the project charter.  The charter doesn't have to be
  perfect; it just has to exist to help the entire project team with their
planning.
* Know what quality means and what's driving your project so you and the team
  can make good decisions as you proceed.

Planning the Project
--------------------

## Plan Just Enough to Start

* Your plan does not have to be perfect.  In fact, there's no way it can be.
  Your plan only has to be good enough to start the project with a chance of
success.

### Timebox

* A timebox is a specific amount of time in which the person or team attempt to
  accomplish a specific task.  As much as the person or the team can
accomplish in that duration is what you bring to the next part of the project.
If necessary, the person/team decreases the scope to complete the timebox.

* Empirical planning - planning just a little and then gather information on
  actual progress to feed back into future planning

* Predictive planning, which is attempting to predict the future, doesn't work
  well unless you have a crystal ball

* Your projects have too much uncertainty and risk to bother planning
  everything in advance.  Plan to start and replan every few weeks.

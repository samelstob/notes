Getting THings Done
===================

Chapter 1
---------

The Real Work of Knowledge Work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* You have to think about your stuff more than you realize but not as much 
  you're afraid you might

Why things are you your mind
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most often, the reason something is "on your mind" is that you want it to be 
different than it currently is, and yet:

* You haven't clarified exactly what the intended outcome is
* You haven't decided what the very next physical action step is
* You haven't put reminders of the outcome and the action required in a system 
  you trust

Managing actions
----------------

* The key to managing all your "stuff" is managing your actions

* It's extremely difficult to manage actions you haven't identified or decided 
  on.  Most people have dozens of things that they need to do to make progress 
  on many fronts. But they don't yet know what they are.

* Another common compliant that "I don't have time to ....." is understandable 
  because many projects seem overwhelming - and are overwhelming because you 
  can't do a project all!  You can only do an action related to it.  Many 
  actions require only a minute or two, in the appropriate context, to move a 
  project forward.


Ch2. Getting control of your life
---------------------------------

5 stages
~~~~~~~~
1. Collect things that command our attention
2. Process what they mean and what to do about them
3. Organise the results, which we
4. Review as options for what we choose to
5. do

1. Collect
----------

* Collect and gather placeholders for all the things you consider incomplete 
  in your world - that is, anything personal or professional, big or little, 
  urgent or minor, that you think ought to be different than it currently is 
  and that you have any level of internal commitment to changing

1. Every open loop must be in your collection system and out of your head
2. You must have as few collection buckets as you can get by with
3. You must empty them regularly.

2. Process
----------

1. Is it actionable?  There are two possible answers: yes and no

No::

Trash;; It's trash
Incubate;; No action is needed now, but something might need to be done later
Reference;; The item is potentially useful info that might be needed for something later

Yes::

Desired outcome;; What project or outcome have you committed to
Next action;; What's the next action required

Next action::

* Do it (less than 2 mins)
* Delegate it
* Defer it

When you finished processing you will have

1. Trashed what you don't need
2. Completed any less than two minute actions
3. Handed off to others anything that can be delegated
4. Sorted into our own organising system reminders of actions that require 
   more than two minutes
5. Identified any larger commitments (projects) you now have, based on the 
   input

3. Organise
-----------

* The calendar should be sacred territory.  If you write something there, it 
  must get done that day or not at all.

4. Review
---------

* Most people feel best about their work the week before their vacation - you 
  clean up, close up, clarify, and renogtiate all your agreements with 
  yourself and others.  I suggest that you do this weekly instead of yearly.

Manager tools - Delegation
==========================

* In military they get people to be leaders by giving them things to do, and 
  they expect them to do it and they hold them accountable and give them 
  feedback and consequences and reward them when they do

* The captain is very worried about his entire unit.  Anything that doesn't 
  affect the entire unit the captain is going to delegate to the lieutenants.
  The lieutenants is going to delegate to sergeants.

* A lot of managers could benefit by learning how to delegate.

* Delegation is not just a way to lessen your own workload.  But it serves the 
  additional purpose of developing other leaders in your organisation.

* To delegate well you're going to have to learn about feedback and coaching.

* If a leader is not an effective delegator they're probably doing the wrong 
  work.  "If it's not a big rock, you ought not to be working on it."

* What about the work at the bottom?  The fact is there is a bunch of work at 
  that shouldn't be being done anyway.

* We all have too much to do, we're all making choices.  People are leaving 
  their desks with work on it.  It's about making choices about what work 
  you're going to do.

* Not delegating enough

* Delegating the wrong thing

* Should I be delegating more?
    - Do I allow my team members to make mistakes? If you don't allow your 
      team members to make mistakes you are probably not delegating enough.
    - There are very few jobs where mistakes are not tolerated.
    - Do you frequently take home work?  If yes, you're not delegating enough.
    - Does your team function smoothly in your absence?  Is there a bunch of people waiting to ask you questions when you get back?

* You're going to require people to do it to the standard you would have and 
  give them feedback if they don't.

* Delegation
    - Provides authority.  If you delegate something to me, I get your level 
      of authority to get the job done.  Especially within the ideas of others 
      within the organisation "Mark is now in charge of project X, that means 
      he'll be handling the budget, blah.  I expect you to work with Mark on 
      this."

    - Accountability.  Consequences - rewarded if it goes well.  Delegation is 
      not the same as walking away from something.  To get the best work it 
      has to feel like they're the one in the spotlight.  The manager is 
      coaching, giving feedback, giving guidance.

    - Without the accountability it will feel like you are just giving them 
      things.

    - Most people who delegate shield their people too much.

* A couple of things that people tend to do wrong with Delegation

    - They say "Hey I need you to do something for me."  That is not 
      delegation - you may as well ask them to serve you.  It's grossly 
      ineffective.  They are taking care of a task - that's not delegation.

    - "Tell people you are doing it for me".  Instead I should tell other 
      people that "Blah is doing it"  not "Blah is doing it for me".

* Too much of management training is about the being not the doing.

* Step 1: Analyse your job
    - Look at your key objectives.  What's expected of you?  Choose the top 
      couple and don't delegate those.
    - v6 UI success
    - e.g. If it's not more than Â£5000 don't bother me

* Step 2: Can anyone else do it?  If they can and it's not one of the top two, 
  it's something that could be delegated.

* Should it be delegated?  It depends.  Not 100%.  Right now, the average 
  manager could double or triple what they are delegating now.

* Start and be pretty bold about it.

* Here are some suggestions:
    - Look at areas you dislike.  It's unlikely that your primary area of 
      responsibility is an area you dislike.  Delegate the things you don't 
      like.  (Don't tell people this is why you are delegating).  It will make 
      you more effective.

    - Example: Nurse manager hated doing the scheduling on Monday, got sick on 
      Sunday night because she hated it.  She handed it to one of her charge 
      nurses who said "This is the kind of thing I love to do!".  The Nurse 
      manager thought she would be in trouble - that there were some rule 
      that she had to do it.

    - This is one of the reasons developing a diverse team is so important.  
      If you have a bunch of people like you...

    - There are some admin things you might not like that you have to do.

    - Ineffective managers try to do as much as they possibly can, and then if 
      their is anything less they pass it on.

    - Instead look at areas you don't like, areas where your team is more 
      qualified than you.

    - This is predicated on the fact you know about your folks (one on ones).

    - Consider for your high performers things that will round them out and 
      developer them, things that will get them noticed (even if it's things 
      they won't like).

* If once a month at a minimum one of your one on ones is used for delegation, 
  that is the minimum you should be delegating.
  
* Plan your delegation

    - Think through before you ask them to accept responsibility.

    - Have an answer for some of their objections and concerns.

    - Schedule it in advance, don't do it in passing.  One on ones are 
      wonderful place to do this.

    - Focus on results versus methods.  This is one of the top three failings 
      of managers who don't delegate.  "The other way works just fine.  People 
      don't have to be just like you to get promoted to your role".

    - If you delegate the person you delegate to gets to choose the steps.  
      "We're going northwest" NO "We need to get to the top of that hill by 
      day 3"

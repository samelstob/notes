What are somethings we could measure which would help us improve?
What are somethings I could measure which could help me improve?

* Days from original deadline
* Number of times requirements changed
* Number of migration errors

------------------------

* No place for storing current deadline
    - Front page of wiki?
* What to do with daily todo list?
    - One file
    - Many files
    - Automatic git
* Where to store time tracking for me?
    - TaskJuggler
    - Wiki
    - Text file
    - Spreadsheet
    - Database
    - Prolog

It's not possible to complete, or even make progress on all the things I can 
think of.  This means that prioritising and managing a large list of stuff is 
an very important skill.

How many items on the todo list?
grep '^*' todo.txt |wc -l
328
How many minutes a week 40*60=2400.
But how many do you realistically have for progressing tasks? 10*60=600.
This allows less than 2 minutes per task.
What about per month? 8 minutes per task.

So what does this mean?  Something has to change.
What can be done with tasks?  This is where getting things done comes in.
* Is it actionable?
** No
*** Reference
*** Tickle - someday maybe
*** Bin
** Yes
- Do it
- Delegate it
- Defer it

Mainly these are tasks that are probably in the actionable list.  Are they 
tasks I can delegate (they are relevant to dev?)  If so then it's a simply a 
case of making a case for them which I am okay at.  If not then I need a list 
of criteria for deciding which ones to work on.

Ideas
~~~~~

* Consider filing process improvements stuff in one place e.g. wiki and share
* Add good links to read to wiki
* Add dev meeting ideas to wiki

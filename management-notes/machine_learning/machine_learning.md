## Machine Learning for Humans, Part 2.1: Supervised Learning

Supervised learning
  - Training examples with labels
  "For example, when learning to classify handwritten digits, a supervised
learning algorithm takes thousands of pictures of handwritten digits along
with labels containing the correct number each image represents"

Regression: predict a continuous numerical value. How much will that house sell for?

Classification: assign a label. Is this a picture of a cat or a dog?

A common problem in machine learning is overfitting: learning a function that perfectly explains the training data that the model learned from, but doesnâ€™t generalize well to unseen test data.

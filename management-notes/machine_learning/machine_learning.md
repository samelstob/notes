## Machine Learning for Humans, Part 2.1: Supervised Learning

Supervised learning
  - Training examples with labels
  "For example, when learning to classify handwritten digits, a supervised
learning algorithm takes thousands of pictures of handwritten digits along
with labels containing the correct number each image represents"

Regression: predict a continuous numerical value. How much will that house sell for?

Classification: assign a label. Is this a picture of a cat or a dog?

A common problem in machine learning is overfitting: learning a function that perfectly explains the training data that the model learned from, but doesn’t generalize well to unseen test data.

## Machine Learning for Humans, Part 4: Neural Networks & Deep Learning

* Convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs are designed specifically for
taking images as input, and are effective for computer vision tasks. They are
also instrumental in deep reinforcement learning. CNNs are specifically
inspired by the way animal visual cortices work, and they’re the focus of the
deep learning course we’ve been referencing throughout this article,
Stanford’s CS231n.  

## Machine Learning for Humans, Part 5: Reinforcement Learning

* Exploration/Explotation trade-off.  
  - How should you balance exploting what you have already found versus
    exploring something new for even greater rewards

Back of the Envelope #11 - Cloud
--------------------------------

Thursday, 08 November 2012

* Outlook versus GMail.  People used to wonder "But why would I want to keep 
  all my email"
* People in IT who instantly dismiss something new that is experiencing huge 
  growth are silly (e.g. Twitter, iPad)
* If you're not using Google Apps or Office 365 you have to ask why not
* No competitive advantage from managing your own email server
* If an application is hosted you get upgrades.
* Be on the lookout for disruptive IT
* Most IT is terrible.  Why would you want to move it to the cloud.  Instead 
  do it better.
* Trying to compete with e.g. Amazon/Apple by saying "We're going to add 
  enterprise features" may be silly.  Maybe people don't need that.

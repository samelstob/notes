# Fearless Change

## Official Skeptic

"Astronomer Carl Sagan said that we need a balance between two conflicting
needs - the most skeptical scrutiny of all ideas that are served up to us and a
great openness to new ideas.  If you are only skeptical, then you never learn
anything new.  You become a crotchety old person convinced that nonsense is
ruling the world.  (There is, of course, much data to support you).  On the
other hand, if you are open to the point of gullibility and have not an ounce
of skeptical sense in you, then you cannot distinguish useful ideas from the
worthless ones."

* Ask for help from strong opinion leaders, who are skpetical of your new
  idea, to play the role of "official skeptic."  Use their comments to improve
your effort, even if you don't change their minds.

Skeptics who are "gurus" and "connectors" may stifle your efforts unless your
change their minds, limit their impact or ask them to help you.

You may not be able to change their minds but if they are offered a role in
the initiative they could change from a skeptical outsider to an insider who
could make a positive contribution.

* "Ask for help from a skeptical opinion leader to play the role of "official
  skeptic" or "official realist"

## Fear Less

*Any innovation is disruptive, so resistance is likely"*

Every change agent complains about resistance, but if you think tis is bad,
consider the alternative.  Its'f rightnening to imagine a situation with no
resistance at all.

* In her book Soul in the Computer, Barbara Waugh says "I force myself to ask
  of every obstacle, 'What if this is a gift?  What is it that this obstacle
or setback is telling me?'  Someone who is initially the most skeptical may
become my best partner, constantly detecting the hype and fluff and
unnecessary complexity in my thinking about what we are doign and what the
next steps are"

* The first step in dealing with opposition is to appreciate it.  Get it out
  in the open, rather than let it fester in the dark.

* No course of action is perfect.  Skeptics present gifts; they provide us
  with information about the route we've chosen and how to alter our approach
and our goals.

* Fears typucally  manifest themselves as resistance.  You reaction is likely
  to advocate your views harder.  That too is motivatd by fear: the fear of
looking bad when everyone is watching, the fear that your ideas may, in fact,
be wrong.
* Resistance is not the primary reason why changes fail.  It's the reaction to
  resistance that creates problems.

* IT's hard to listen to people when we don't agree with them.  Usually we
  just elaborate our point of view or repeat what we've said.  A better
approach is to encourage the other person to say more about his point of view.
Some times just hearing what another has to say will help both of you reach a
better understanding.

* *Ask for help from resistors.* Listen, really listen, to what a skeptic has
  to say and learn from him.  Try to appreciate the differences in opinion.
When people disagree with you, stop and think about the value in seeing things
from their perspective.  Rather than hiding the potential problems, ask for
input on ways to address them, and then seek to understand.
* Be sure the skeptic knows you are listening.  Acknolwedge and validate his
  expertise.  Ask questions.  Try to understand his arguments.
* Include his objections as limitations and topics to consider when you do
  presentations or lead discussions on the new idea.
* It's a natrual human tendency to shy away from criticism., but ic an be a
  sign of a healthy, vital culture when peopl care enough to air their
concerns.
* Find something to appreciate in all those who aren't on your wavelength.
  Appreciation can be an antidote to fear.
* The way you operate toward them will elicit the personality you see - the
  resistor you fear or the best person someone is capable of being.
* The skeptics must be willing to talk and to listen - if they are not, put
  your energy elsewhere.
* Other people who see you dealing respectfully with resistors, and even
  raising objections in advance, are likely to be impressed with you as the
messenger of a new idea.
* Resistors can overwhelm you if you are not prepared to handle criticism.
  Encourage them to talk with you one-on-one to protect yourself from a verbal
attack in public that can end up damaging your cause.

Exploring a graph

BFS
Shortest paths of unweighted graphs

DFS
Detect cycles
Topological sort

Optimal Substructure

An optimal solution to the global problem contains within it optimal solutions to
sub-problems

Classic example is shortest paths.  Sub-problems of shortest paths are
shortest paths.

Greedy

Making a locally optimal choice leads to a globally optimal solution

Classic example is Fractional Knapsack - take as much of the highest value
item, then as much of the next highest value item

Overlapping Sub-problems

Classic example: Fibonacci

Independent Sub-problems

Sub-problems can be worked in any order and in parallel.  Sub-problems are
dependent if the input to one depends on the output of another.

Each level in merge sort depends on the output of the previous level

D.P

"Careful" bruteforce - guess all of them
Recursion + memoization
Top-down
Bottom - sub-problem DAG

Classic example



Dijkstra is a greedy algorithm

Dijkstra


BFS

# Initialise
def initialise(G):
  for u in G:
    u.colour = black
    u.predecessor = null
    u.distance = 0

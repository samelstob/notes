# Proofs

* "Distinguish a very plausible argument which might not be tottally right from a proof which is totally right"

* a^2 + b^2 = c^2
  - Is it familiar - yes, is it obvious no
* Over 100 proofs
* Proof by picture - elegant and correct
  - worrisome in general
  - hidden assumptions
* Getting rich - proof by diagram

## Proofs exist beyond mathematics

* A proof is a method for ascertaining (establishing, verifying) the truth 
* Experiment and observation
* Sampling and counterexamples: Truth is the opposite of falsehood - find counterexamples
* Jurys or judges
* Word of authority, word of god 
* Inner conviction - very popular in computer science "There are no bugs in my
  code", "I don't see why not"
* A mathematical proof is a verification of a proposition by a chain of logical
  deductions from a set of of axioms 
  - Proposition
  - Logical deductions
  - Axioms

## Propositions

* A proposition is a statement that is either true or false
   Îµ

  For all n in the naturual numbers {0,1,2,3,...} n^2+n+41 is prime

  ^ quantifier     ^ universe of discourse        ^ predicate

  Predicate is a proposition whose truth depends on the value of a variable

  To see if this proposition is true we need to see if this predicate is true
for all natural numbers


  n     n^2+n+41    prime 
  0     41          y
  1     43          y
  2     47          Y
  3     53          Y
  20    461         y
  39    1601        y

The first 40 values of n the proposition is true.  In a lot of fields physics,
statistics if you checked 40 examples "it must be true".

  40    1681        n

Example:

  a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = d^4   has no positive integer solutions

  This proposition was conjectured to be true by Euler in 1769.  It was
unsolved for 2 centuries.

  A counter example was found 2 centuries later.

  313(x^3 + y^3) = z^3 has no positive integer solutions

  false - but the shortest counter example has over a thousand digits - you
would never use a computer to exhaustively search

Why would you care?  This equation is an example of an elliptic curve.
Elliptic curve is used in cryptosystems.

Example:

  The regions of a map can be coloured in 4 colours so that adjacent regions
have different colours

Conjected by Guthrie in 1853

There were many false proofs over the next century.  There was a convincing
proof for over a decade.  Proofs by picture are often very convincing and very
wrong.

The four colour theorom was finally prooved in 1977 but they had to use a
computer to check thousands of cases.  This was disturbing to mathematicians -
who do you know the computer did the right thing.

A few years ago a 12 page human proof was discovered - but people are
suspcious.

Example: Every positive even integer but 2 is the sum of 2 primes.  e.g. 24 is
the sum of 11 and 13

  Goldbach's conjecture - 1742 - no one knows - one of the great unsolved
mysteries

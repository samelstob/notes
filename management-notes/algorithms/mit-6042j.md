# Proofs

* "Distinguish a very plausible argument which might not be tottally right from a proof which is totally right"

* a^2 + b^2 = c^2
  - Is it familiar - yes, is it obvious no
* Over 100 proofs
* Proof by picture - elegant and correct
  - worrisome in general
  - hidden assumptions
* Getting rich - proof by diagram

## Proofs exist beyond mathematics

* A proof is a method for ascertaining (establishing, verifying) the truth 
* Experiment and observation
* Sampling and counterexamples: Truth is the opposite of falsehood - find counterexamples
* Jurys or judges
* Word of authority, word of god 
* Inner conviction - very popular in computer science "There are no bugs in my
  code", "I don't see why not"
* A mathematical proof is a verification of a proposition by a chain of logical
  deductions from a set of of axioms 
  - Proposition
  - Logical deductions
  - Axioms

## Propositions

* A proposition is a statement that is either true or false
   Îµ

  For all n in the naturual numbers {0,1,2,3,...} n^2+n+41 is prime

  ^ quantifier     ^ universe of discourse        ^ predicate

  Predicate is a proposition whose truth depends on the value of a variable

  To see if this proposition is true we need to see if this predicate is true
for all natural numbers


  n     n^2+n+41    prime 
  0     41          y
  1     43          y
  2     47          Y
  3     53          Y
  20    461         y
  39    1601        y

The first 40 values of n the proposition is true.  In a lot of fields physics,
statistics if you checked 40 examples "it must be true".

  40    1681        n

Example:

  a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = d^4   has no positive integer solutions

  This proposition was conjectured to be true by Euler in 1769.  It was
unsolved for 2 centuries.

  A counter example was found 2 centuries later.

  313(x^3 + y^3) = z^3 has no positive integer solutions

  false - but the shortest counter example has over a thousand digits - you
would never use a computer to exhaustively search

Why would you care?  This equation is an example of an elliptic curve.
Elliptic curve is used in cryptosystems.

Example:

  The regions of a map can be coloured in 4 colours so that adjacent regions
have different colours

Conjected by Guthrie in 1853

There were many false proofs over the next century.  There was a convincing
proof for over a decade.  Proofs by picture are often very convincing and very
wrong.

The four colour theorom was finally prooved in 1977 but they had to use a
computer to check thousands of cases.  This was disturbing to mathematicians -
who do you know the computer did the right thing.

A few years ago a 12 page human proof was discovered - but people are
suspcious.

Example: Every positive even integer but 2 is the sum of 2 primes.  e.g. 24 is
the sum of 11 and 13

  Goldbach's conjecture - 1742 - no one knows - one of the great unsolved
mysteries

Example: Riemann hypothesis
Poincare conjecture - prooved in 2003 - won the fields medal

Example: For all n in the integers {0,1,-1,2,-2,...} n>2 implies n^2 > 4

Definition: An implication p implies q is true if p is false or q is true

False implies anything is true i.e. If pigs can fly, I am king is true because "p" is false

Example: For all integers, n > 2 if and only if n^2 > 4
  - if and only if has to applied both ways

  p     q     p => q    q => p      p <=> q
  T     T     T         T           T
  T     F     F         T           F 
  F     T     T         F           F
  F     F     T         T           T

## Axioms

* An axiom is a proposition that is assumed to be true

  - Axiom - from Greek "to think worthy"
  - Often we say don't make assumptions - you have to make assumptions
    otherwise you can'tt do anything.  They key is to identify your
assumptions so that people can see them.

* There are lots of axioms used in maths e.g. if a=b and b=c then a=c
* Euclidian geomtry, spherical geomtry, hyperbolic geomtry seem to have
  conflicting axioms - this is fine as long as you declare you axioms
* Axioms should be consistent and complete

Definition:
  - A set of axioms is consistent if no proposition to be both true
  - A set of axioms is complete if it can be used to proove every proposition
    is either true or false

Some mathemticians spent their entire careers trying to get to this. Kurt Godel in 1930s prooved it is not possible there exists any set of axioms that is both consistent and complete.

You can state a problem that you can't proove

When you parents told you if you work hard enough you can do anything - they
were wrong.

and false

# Proofs

* "Distinguish a very plausible argument which might not be totally right from
  a proof which is totally right"

* a^2 + b^2 = c^2
  - Is it familiar - yes, is it obvious no
* Over 100 proofs
* Proof by picture - elegant and correct
  - worrisome in general
  - hidden assumptions

## Proofs exist beyond mathematics

* A proof is a method for ascertaining (establishing, verifying) the truth 
* Experiment and observation
* Sampling and counterexamples: Truth is the opposite of falsehood - find counterexamples
* Jurys or judges
* Word of authority, word of god 
* Inner conviction - very popular in computer science!
  - "There are no bugs in my code"
  - "I don't see why not"
* A mathematical proof is a verification of a proposition by a chain of logical
  deductions from a set of of axioms 
  - Proposition
  - Logical deductions
  - Axioms

## Propositions

* A proposition is a statement that is either true or false
   Îµ

  For all n in the natural numbers {0,1,2,3,...} n^2+n+41 is prime

  ^ quantifier     ^ universe of discourse        ^ predicate

  Predicate is a proposition whose truth depends on the value of a variable

  To see if this proposition is true we need to see if this predicate is true
for all natural numbers

  n     n^2+n+41    prime 
  0     41          y
  1     43          y
  2     47          Y
  3     53          Y
  20    461         y
  39    1601        y

The first 40 values of n the proposition is true.  In a lot of fields e.g. physics,
statistics if you checked 40 examples "it must be true".

  40    1681        n

Example:

  a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = d^4   has no positive integer solutions

  This proposition was conjectured to be true by Euler in 1769.  It was
unsolved for 2 centuries.

  A counter example was found 2 centuries later.

  313(x^3 + y^3) = z^3 has no positive integer solutions

  false - but the shortest counter example has over a thousand digits - you
would never use a computer to exhaustively search

Why would you care?  This equation is an example of an elliptic curve.
Elliptic curve is used in cryptosystems.

Example:

  The regions of a map can be coloured in 4 colours so that adjacent regions
have different colours

Conjectured by Guthrie in 1853

There were many false proofs over the next century.  There was a convincing
proof for over a decade.  Proofs by picture are often very convincing and very
wrong.

The four colour theorem was finally proved in 1977 but they had to use a
computer to check thousands of cases.  This was disturbing to mathematicians -
how do you know the computer did the right thing.

A few years ago a 12 page human proof was discovered - but people are
suspicious.

Example: Every positive even integer but 2 is the sum of 2 primes.  e.g. 24 is
the sum of 11 and 13

  Goldbach's conjecture - 1742 - no one knows - one of the great unsolved
mysteries

Example: Riemann hypothesis
Poincare conjecture - prooved in 2003 - won the fields medal
  - All shapes in 3 dimensions are deformations of a sphere?

Example: For all n in the integers {0,1,-1,2,-2,...} n>2 implies n^2 > 4

## Definition: An implication p implies q is true if p is false or q is true

False implies anything is true i.e. If pigs can fly, I am king is true because
"p" is false

Example: For all integers, n > 2 if and only if n^2 > 4
  - if and only if has to applied both ways

  p     q     p => q    q => p      p <=> q
  T     T     T         T           T
  T     F     F         T           F 
  F     T     T         F           F
  F     F     T         T           T

## Axioms

* An axiom is a proposition that is assumed to be true

  - Axiom - from Greek "to think worthy"
  - Often we say don't make assumptions - you have to make assumptions
    otherwise you can't do anything!  They key is to identify your assumptions
so that people can see them.

* There are lots of axioms used in maths e.g. if a=b and b=c then a=c
* Euclidean geometry, spherical geometry, hyperbolic geometry seem to have
  conflicting axioms - this is fine as long as you declare you axioms
* Axioms *should* be consistent and complete

Definition:
  - A set of axioms is consistent if no proposition to be both true
  - A set of axioms is complete if it can be used to proove every proposition
    is either true or false

Some mathematicians spent their entire careers trying to get to a set of
axioms that was consistent and complete. Kurt Godel in 1930s prooved it is not
possible there exists any set of axioms that is both consistent and complete.

If a set of axioms is not complete you can state a problem that you can't proove

When you parents told you if you work hard enough you can do anything - they
were wrong.

and false

# Lecture 2: Induction

## Proof by Contractdition - assume the opposite of what you are trying to proove

To proove a proposition P is true, we assume P is False then use that
hypoethesis to derive a falsehood or contradiction

Example: Theorem sqrt(2) is irrational

Pf (by Cont.)

Assume for purpose of contradiction that sqrt(2) is rational

  sqrt(2) = a/b (fraction in lowest terms - i.e. a and b have no common
divisors)
  2 = a^2 / b^2
  2b^2 = a^2
  => a is even (2 | a)
  => 4 | a^2
  => 4 | 2b^2
  => 2 | b^2
  => b is even => a/b is not in lowest terms => contradiction
  => sqrt(2) is irrational

Pythagoreans didn't believe that sqrt(2) was irrational and covered it
up.

* Getting rich - proof by diagram - the error is in the first step - the
  diagram was incorrect

## Proof by Induction

* Induction axiom
  - Let P(n) be a predicate.
  - If P(0) is true and for all natrual numbers P(n) => P(n+1) is true then
    for all naturual numbers P(n) is true

* if P(0), P(0) => P(1), P(1) => P(2), P(2) => P(3), ...  are true
  - Like truth dominoes!

Theorom: For all naturual numbers 1+2+3+...+n = n(n+1)/2

Proof: by induction

Let P(n) be proposition

Base Case P(0) is true

  0 = 0(0+1)/2

Inductive Step 

  - For n >= 0, show P(n) => P(n+1) is true

Assume P(n) is true for purposes of induction

  - We are assuming this within the context of establishing that the
    implication is true

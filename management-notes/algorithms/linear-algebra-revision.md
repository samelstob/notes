Don't really get it

Vectors and Matrices

Somehow becomes the maths of the 21st Century!

Vectors describe a movement - can visualise them as arrows with the base at
the origin and tip at the location of the vector

Vectors are written vertically 

[ x ]
[ y ]

A scalar is a number which scales a vector

basis vectors i^, j^

Can think of transformations as changing the basis vectors

e.g.

Two vectors are linearly dependent if they point in the same direction

The span of two vectors is the points that can be reached from adding them

A linear transformation is a transformation where the "grid lines" remain
parallel and equally spaced

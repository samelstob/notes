Leading a Software Development Team
===================================

9 How do I draw up a project plan?  What use it it?
---------------------------------------------------

Why plan?
~~~~~~~~

* To give you and your team a framework to think within.

    - Just as a drawing of the technical architecture of the project lets you 
      think about the technical solution, so the project plan lets you think 
      about the organization of the project.

    - Work needs organizing and structuring, every bit as much as software 
      does.

    - It's not the doc but the mental effort that is valuable:  "The 
      documentation that results is not the thing of value.  It's the mental 
      effort, forced on you by having to confront the issues, that is 
      valuable."

* A plan is needed for negotiating with people - managers, customers, other 
  teams

* It helps defend your decisions.

* It is a communication tool.

Stress
------

* If people are stressed then manage interruptions

* Say "No" to extra work, features, bugs, demos, meetings


22 I've got someone on my team who's a real problem
---------------------------------------------------

* Don't act too soon.  Whilst you can't let personnel problems drag on for 
  months, it's a mistake to think that you should try to sort them out in a 
  matter of a day or two.  You can't judge someone's behaviour that quickly, 
  and you can't expect people to modify their behaviour that fast.

* Everyone has bad days, and bad weeks.

* Someone who seems to challenge everything you say can also be very helpful.  
  It depends whether the challenge comes from someone who is trying to help 
  get a better job done, or someone who would disagree with you whatever you 
  said.

* It's very important with personnel issues to try to get to the root cause of 
  the problem.
    - People may have a bad attitude because they have been stuck doing boring 
      or menial work for a long time.  Or by them being given too much work to 
      which they are not suited.
    - Organisational problems - people managed by different people working 
      together on the ground will often be working towards contrary priorities 
      and perspectives.  They get stressed by the individual issues, the 
      apparent unhelpfulneess and inflexibility of the 'other lot'.
    - If someone is dragging out work, they may be doing so because they are 
      not looking forward to the task that is coming next, or they may even 
      believe that there is no more work waiting for them to do and they might 
      fear losing their job.
    - If someone is always chatting, they may be bored with work that is too 
      easy for them.
    - Someone may have poor time-keeping because of person problems (e.g. 
      childcare).
    - People become difficult and uncommunicative if they are under too much 
      stress.
    - Poor perfomrnace may be due to poor training or poor coaching.  No one 
      can do a job well if they are not confident of the skills required.
    - Dropping people in the deep end suits some people but not others.  For 
      many people, trying to do a job without prior training saps the 
      confidence and reduces morale.
    - If someone is sinking rather than swimming - you should give them work 
      that is easier and which helps their learning.  Build up their 
      confidence and give time and training to bring them up to speed.
* Poor performance can also be caused by poor leadership.  You need to bsure 
  that you are not actually the cause of the problem.

* You need to talk to the person to find out what is going on.  This is a very 
  difficult thing to do.  It has to be done informally and sensitively.
* You need to keep the focus on the problem, not the personality.  Talk about 
  what is happening, and ask why it is happening.  Explain why it is causing a 
  problem to you.

* If someone is not doing the work you require, you need to get more rigorous, 
  and a little more formal, about the way you allocate work to them.
    - Make extra sure that the person knows what you expect them to deliver, 
      and when.
    - Make any constraints or preferences clear.
    - If you don't spell out what you want, you cannot complain if you don't 
      get it.
    - Allocate smaller tasks, and review work more often, to give a chance for 
      the person to learn what is required without having to do huge amounts 
      of rework.

* Insist only on those points that you specified when you allocated the work, 
  and no more.  For instance , if you review some code and find it has no 
  error checking, then explain the value of error checking, and be clear that 
  you expect it to be done next time.

* This situation is unstable and can only go two ways.  The person will either 
  realise what is expected of them and start to perform, or things will 
  deteriorate completely.
    - For this reason, you must start off gently, giving a little more 
      guidance and being a little more formal.  It should be hardly 
      perceptible at first.  Escalate it slowly if necessary.  If you go in 
      too hard, you will be open to the accusation of vicitimization.

* When all is said and done, there are still some people who are simply in the 
  wrong job.  Nobody is useless, but some people are pretty useless at the 
  work they are currently being asked to perform.

* If someone is not pulling their weight, it is not fair on the rest of the 
  team, nor to your customers or the rest of the organisation, to allow it to 
  continue.

* The defining question is 'do I trust this person to be on my team?'.  Trust 
  is vital.  You should always start off with the assumption that people are 
  trustworth and can be allowed to get on with things in their own way.  But 
  if you find that you cannot trust somebody on your team, then you should get 
  rid of them.

* Most personnel issues are not black and white; people are not either 'good' 
  or 'bad, 'brilliant' or 'incompetent'.  Often, able people are given the 
  wrong jobs, get poor training, or are put under inteolerable pressure, and 
  may respond by becomiong negative, unproductive or disruptive.
* With careful thought and sensitive consideration, many such problems can be 
  resolved.  But there are people who are in the wrong team or the wrong job 
  and cannot be trusted to continue, and these people should be removed.


Dealing with boring/menial work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Ensure that allocation is even
* Take on some yourself
* Automate some of it
* Talk to the person and support them

* How complex systems fail?
** Design for maintenance.  Maintenance is continuous.
** Expose controls to operators and trust them with the controls.  We need
operators to be able to act when they are the only ones able to do so.
** Expose the "lift points".  Heavy machinery has "lift points" because we
know it's going to be moved.
** Support mental simulation.  Operators need to be able to mental simulate
what will happen if that take some action.  You need to present detailed
status to operators to support this.
* In order to be able reason about the system is working, we have to have
  knowledge inside the blackbox.  Empower the operator.  Get rid of the idea
  that there are parts of the systems we can't go.
* You should be willing to turn over the "keys to the system" to your
  operators.
* Commit the resources to discovering, understanding resilience throughout the
  lifecycle.

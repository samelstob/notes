"Businesses continue to make irresponsible commitments to customers and 
investors. This only perpetuates crystal-ball thinking, fixed-date, 
fixed-scope and fixed-cost projects. It’s the classic sales-driven model we 
see all too often where the sales arm doesn’t respect the capability of its 
product development group to produce predictable value for the customer in a 
timely manner, and with an agreed-upon level of quality. After all, quality is 
a business decision."

"Doing Agile isn’t the same as being Agile. The essential point is that we are 
“Doing Agile” when we follow practices and we are “Being Agile” when we act 
with an Agile mindset. Experienced practitioners know the practices are a 
means to an end."

minimal marketable features

"The term “minimal marketable feature” was first used in the book Software by 
Numbers. This book placed emphasis on the smallest portion of work that could 
be release into production and have value to its resulting customers or 
users."

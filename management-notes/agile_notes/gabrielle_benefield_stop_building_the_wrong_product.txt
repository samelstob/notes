# Stop Building The Wrong Product

Agile allows us to go faster

Don't confuse faster with value

More features might be the wrong features

Most businesses are simple e.g amazon but a book, Skype make a call

Take things away that get in the way of the primary goal of the user

Use data to back decisions

Use guerrilla low cost user testing. Make sure developers see users using the hing they have built

Research is too important to leave to the researchers

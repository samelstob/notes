# We are pretty good at building

* MMA
* XML DE2
* New charts

# We are pretty good at vision and strategy

* TWS

# Friction and stress

* Quality work takes time and costs
* We can only work on one thing at a time
* We can't do everything we want to do
* We don't know now what we know next week
* We can't say accurately when things will be done
* We have to change priorities frequently

"No battle plan survives contact with the enemy"

# The Enemy of Planning

* SWOT
* Technology
* Customers
* Risk and uncertainty
* Emergent requirements

"If I'd given them what they wanted, they would have asked for faster horses"

* Is this a battle we can win?

* Can we stop the world moving on?
* Can we ensure that customers tell us everything they want upfront

* Risk and uncertainity

* Most projects of value have risk

* Change tactics - agile

* Adapatability
* "Agility"
* Learning
"Be small and nimble"

"Known unknowns"

# Make the cost of replanning small

# Incorporate feedback and learning into how we work

* Be open to learning - learning is good

# Deliver value frequenty

* Break work down into MMFs

# Attack risk and uncertainity where possible

Work incrementally and iteratively


# So Agile means no plans?  Anarchy!

* The right amount of planning
* Plan to replan
"Planing is everything, but plans are nothing"

# We are not able to stick to a plan

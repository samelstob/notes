# Essential Scrum

# Chapter 14 Scrum Planning Principles

* Don't assume we can get the plans right up front

* Balance up front and just-in-time planning.
* Keep important options open until the last responsible moment.

* Focus 

* "When lost in the woods, if the map doesn't agree with the terrain, in all 
  cases believe the terrain"

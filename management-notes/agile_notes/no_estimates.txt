"this date can’t possibly be right. It’s based on an unrealistic list of 
requirements, using weak estimates, made at the moment of maximum ignorance, 
by people who are always optimistic about their own abilities. It has been 
squeezed down by managers who think they need to be tough, and sometimes it is 
just overridden by someone who has made a rash promise to someone higher up 
the food chain."

"management tries to force the team to do more than they can do, demanding 
that the team “become more productive,” which means “go faster, promise more, 
and get it done.”"

"Most of the time, “they” know how many people they’ll give us, and how much 
time. They do that head-shaking thing until we “estimate” the numbers they 
have in mind. So we should turn the question around. “How much did you want to 
spend, and when did you hope to see the product?” Then they tell us, and we 
decide whether we can do something reasonable within that budget."

Why are you estimating?

* Predictability
* T

The Design of Everyday Things
=============================

1. The Psychopathology of everyday things
-----------------------------------------

Conceptual Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Principles of design for understandability and usability::

1. Provide a good conceptual model
2. Make things visible

* The mental model of how the systems works
* Problems arise when the user's conceptual model differs from the systems

==== Examples at Trio ====

* Dashboards and published reports

- It is not necessarily clear that dashboards are built from published reports
- We could display the items that make up 

* Published reports and IGUI/parent reports

- We could display the items that a published report was created from

* Data sources

- It is not clear that some published reports draw from the same data source.  
  Data source is completely hidden from the user.

* Published reports

- It is not necessarily clear what the result of publishing is
    - schedule
    - stored query
    - stored data

- The user has no visibility on these

===== Positive examples =====

* Files and folders
    - We exploit the user's familiarity with files and folders

The principle of mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Mapping is a technical term meaning the relationship between two things, in 
  this case between the controls and their movements and the results in the 
  world.

    - Consider the mapping relationships involved in steering a car.  To turn 
      the car to the right, one turns the steering wheel clockwise.

* Natural mapping, by which I mean taking advantage of physical analogies and 
  cultural standards, leads to immediate understanding.

    - For example, a designer can use spatial analogy: to move an object up, 
      move the control up.

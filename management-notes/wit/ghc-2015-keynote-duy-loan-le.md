# Grace Hopper Conference

## 2010 Keynote - Duy Loan le (Zee Lon Le)
Collaboration across the boundaries

TI - 2002 elected Senior Fellow - joining only four men worldwide in 80 year history

"All my life, in my work, in my community, and even my family I'm surronded
men - and you get tire looking at them"

"8 years later I remain the first and only one.  Let me make it clear - it does
me know good to be the first and the last.  So when I was elected I gave
myself 15 years to work on the second senior fellow (female).  One way or
another we are going to have another female senior fellow at TI even if it
kills me in the process"

"Just like IBM, and Intel, Senior Fellow is the counterpart of senior VP on the
management track.  Carrying that title you assume that my job is technology
based 100% - well that might be true but I can guarantee you that 90% of my
problems have nothing to do with technology - it has to do with people"

## Three Principals

1. First - In order to succeed in life we must collaborate with others but the
first person we must collaborate with is ourselves.  And the first boundary we
must cross over is the personal limitation that life sometimes brings us.

2. Second - We live in a world where technology is pervasive but successful
collaboration still requires relationship building and relationship building is
less science and more art

3. Third - Technology has brought many of us together but I will submit to you
that 100 years from now the world will still be very far apart when it comes
to people's way of life and their personal biases and preferences

## Personal boundaries

"On Apr 22nd 1975 I kissed my father for the last time not knowing whether I would
ever see him again.  I left my country because we had lost it to the enemies.
I left everything I had worked on or for since the age of six.  I set foot
in America only to find I had become both dumb and deaf because I cannot
understand and cannot speak the language.  We gave up everything for a chance
of freedom... The basic freedom that every human being deserves but only those
fortunate enough can enjoy as our right at birth whereas people in other
countries have to fight for with their courage and often with their lives."

"I dreamed of being the best student possible.  During the day I cooked and
cleaned for an entire family of nine.  I tutored and babysat my younger
brothers, sisters and nephew.  At night I studied by translating each word
from English to Vietnamese.  With that dream and hard work four years later at
my high school graduation I stepped up not to receive my high school diploma but
to deliver the valedictorian speech at 16"

"That same year I broke the golden Asian rule - I moved away from my family -
to study engineering in another city; an unmarried daughter is expected to
live with her parents"

"I started my first professional job at TI as a memory designer - bought my
first car in America, bought my mum her first house in America, bought my own
first house in America, got engaged, got married - all within six months - it
was a lot for a kid of 19 turning 20"

"In life we have to collaborate with people to succeed, but the first person
we must collaborate with is ourselves, and the first boundary we must cross
over is the personal limitation that life brings us or sometimes we self
impose"

"When I talk about collaborating with ourselves and breaking our own personal
limitation I'm talking about

i) the willingness to assess our inner potential and the courage to let it
rise and shine.

ii) The clarity to not let the situation that we are in cloud our vision to
see beyond the present impossibility.

iii) I'm talking about the confidence and the faith in our own dreams - chase
them accomplish them and do good with that.

iv) The wisdom as we go through life to not only believe in ourselves but even
more important to believe in others"

"I worry about the younger workforce and the scale of importance of
relationship building in their mind and their know-how of how to go about
doing it"

## Japan and Relationship Building

At 22

"I made my first trip to Japan in 1985.  A quarter of a century ago Japan
was a very different country.  At work there were no women and if you see them they are either cleaning the
restroom or serving tea to the men.  So you can imagine the shock on the faces
of 30 Japanese engineers when I walk into the room and introduce myself as the
senior engineer who just came over to train them"

"I realised the magnitude of my challenge and the naivety of my thinking.  The gap between me and them was too huge - age, gender, custom, history,
language - there was no way I could continue as planned.  So I said to myself
for the next 2 weeks we will discuss and talk about everything except work"

"The one thing that really bothered the Japanese engineers - they could not
believe I left my husband behind for four months"

"After 2 weeks a sense of trust and friendship emerged.  I came to respect
their intelligence and work ethic and the culture and norm in society that
forces them to work so late every night.  They came to respect my no-nonsense
approach and the hardship I had to endure to get to where I was.  The time we
spent together as people facilitated my training tremendously.  From 1985 to
1998 we worked together incredibly well."

"Later in my second job I needed some help.  They did not have to do it but
they jumped through hoops to help me.  There is no way I could have been
successful in that second job without their help"

"Relationship building requires face-to-face interaction.  Even in the world
of technology advancement human relationships are still the key to successful
colloboration.  To build long lasting relationships you have to do it the old
fashioned way - face-to-face.  Of course once the relationship is built you
can leverage technology to keep it going"

## Excellence and Culturual Boundaries

"When we collaborate across the boundaries with other people and other culture
- what is considered excellence in one culuture does not necessarily translate
  into another culuture"

"In this country we value independence, individualism, assertiveness.
Crossing over to the other culture across the pacific ocean the same
attributes can be perceived as disrepectful, non-collaborative, and even
outright arrogant."

"Let me make it claer I did not succeed because I am smarter, or carry a more
important title.  I succeeded simply because I modified the way we ask for
help.  I remember that even though we are negotitate, talking, engaging in
technology it is still people we are dealing with.  People with custom,
feeling, history, certain way of working, living, thinking and colloborating."

## Cross Culturual Competency

A persons linguistic ability and travel frequency does not necessarily
translate into a person cross culturual competency.  To be cross-culutural
copetent you have to understand the culture, think the culuture, and honour
the cultuure"

# Summary

"When we can break our own personal limitation we will be less likely to let
the colour of people's skin, the gender that they were born with, the religion
that they practice, or the culuture that they were borught up with cloud our
ability to see their potential to rise and shine.  We will see people not
through the lenses of impossibility but through the lenses of possibility
because we have seen it in ourselves.  When we believe in ourselves and we
believe in others it is much easier to galvanaize people towards a common
cause.  Believing in others is an attribute of an effective leader in any
culture than I know of"

"How many of you love to go shopping, or movies, or having tea, or playing
golf with people that you don't like?  The reason is very simple you have to feel a sense of commorraderie - friendship with people you do it with.  When you colloborate accorss the bounadray with different people that sense of commorraderi is still very much needed and it starts with relationship building.  Relationship buuiliding cannot be done via technology gadgets alone it requires face-to-face human interaction"

"At the end one's life it is the reltaionship with family, friends, mentors,
colleagues that we wish we had spent more time on"

"It is very easy to think that our business is technology but at the core every business it's really about people.  In order to
successfully collobrate across the boudary of people we have to understand
their lenses of life, respect their way of living, and honour their way of
thinking."

# Grace Hopper Conference

## 2010 Keynote - Duy Loan le (Zee Lon Le)
Collaboration across the boundaries

TI - 2002 elected Senior Fellow - joining only four men worldwide in 80 year history

"All my life, in my work, in my community, and even my family I'm surronded
men - and you get tire looking at them"

"8 years later I remain the first and only one.  Let me make it clear - it does
me know good to be the first and the last.  So when I was elected I gave
myself 15 years to work on the second senior fellow (female).  One way or
another we are going to have another female senior fellow at TI even if it
kills me in the process"

"Just like IBM, and Intel, Senior Fellow is the counterpart of senior VP on the
management track.  Carrying that title you assume that my job is technology
based 100% - well that might be true but I can guarantee you that 90% of my
problems have nothing to do with technology - it has to do with people"

## Three Principals

1. First - In order to succeed in life we must collaborate with others but the
first person we must collaborate with is ourselves.  And the first boundary we
must cross over is the personal limitation that life sometimes brings us.

2. Second - We live in a world where technology is pervasive but successful
collaboration still requires relationship building and relationship building is
less science and more art

3. Third - Technology has brought many of us together but I will submit to you
that 100 years from now the world will still be very far apart when it comes
to people's way of life and their personal biases and preferences

## Personal boundaries

"On Apr 22nd 1975 I kissed my father for the last time not knowing whether I would
ever see him again.  I left my country because we had lost it to the enemies.
I left everything I had worked on or for since the age of six.  I set foot
in America only to find I had become both dumb and deaf because I cannot
understand and cannot speak the language.  We gave up everything for a chance
of freedom... The basic freedom that every human being deserves but only those
fortunate enough can enjoy as our right at birth whereas people in other
countries have to fight for with their courage and often with their lives."

"I dreamed of being the best student possible.  During the day I cooked and
cleaned for an entire family of nine.  I tutored and babysat my younger
brothers, sisters and nephew.  At night I studied by translating each word
from English to Vietnamese.  With that dream and hard work four years later at
my high school graduation I stepped up not to receive my high school diploma but
to deliver the valedictorian speech at 16"

"That same year I broke the golden Asian rule - I moved away from my family -
to study engineering in another city; an unmarried daughter is expected to
live with her parents"

"I started my first professional job at TI as a memory designer - bought my
first car in America, bought my mum her first house in America, bought my own
first house in America, got engaged, got married - all within six months - it
was a lot for a kid of 19 turning 20"

"In life we have to collaborate with people to succeed, but the first person
we must collaborate with is ourselves, and the first boundary we must cross
over is the personal limitation that life brings us or sometimes we self
impose"

"When I talk about collaborating with ourselves and breaking our own personal
limitation I'm talking about

i) the willingness to assess our inner potential and the courage to let it
rise and shine.

ii) The clarity to not let the situation that we are in cloud our vision to
see beyond the present impossibility.

iii) I'm talking about the confidence and the faith in our own dreams - chase
them accomplish them and do good with that.

iv) The wisdom as we go through life to not only believe in ourselves but even
more important to believe in others"

"I worry about the younger workforce and the scale of importance of
relationship building in their mind and their know-how of how to go about
doing it"

## Japan

"I made my first trip to Japan in 1985.  A quarter of a century ago Japan
was a very different country and if you see them they are either cleaning the
restroom or serving tea to the men.  So you can imagine the shock on the faces
of 30 Japanese engineers when I walk into the room and introduce myself as the
senior engineer who just came over to train them"

"No matter what accomplishments you make, somebody helped you"

When you work with people, especially folks that don't directly report to you, you learn to manage situations by managing
relationships with people.

"Many ideas grow better when transplanted into another mind than the one where
they sprang up" Oliver Wendell Holmes

Most of my ideas sound really great to me - then I'll run it by someone and
they'll have a very different perspective.  They are not trying to tear you
down they are trying to get you to think about it from a different angle, a
different perspective and it actually makes your idea better, something more
feasible, something you can actually accomplish.

Relationships are critical - your ability to foster positive relationships
with people.

"It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others
to succeed." Napoleon Hill

No matter what you do in life, no matter who you are, not matter how
successful you are it is imperative you give back in one form or another.

Sharing a little bit of yourself and your experience is critical to giving
back and your ability foster those that come behind you.

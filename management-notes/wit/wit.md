* In 1985 37% of undergrad CS degrees went to women
* In 2011 it was 17%
* By 2022 the US will need 1.2M more computer scientists
* If we assume graduation rates stay the same, only 39% of those needs will be
  filled by US trained.  H1B visas are not plentiful enough to fill that gap
* We need diversity so engineering teams look at problems holistically
* Early voice recognition systems - failed on women because the engineering
  team was all men
* Airbag design - women and children were killed because it was designed for
  men sizes and weight
* In software - if a patent filing team had mixed gender the patent was 26%
  more likely to be cited as compared to similar patents
* Fortune 500 companies with female CEOs outperformed the market
* Why this decline in grads?
* IBM launched PC in 1981, Apple Mac in 1984
* Sheryl Sandberg - summer code camp (7 year olds) - only 5 girls out of 50  -
  unconscious bias
* Harvey Mudd College - went from 10% to 50% grads
  - Offer two sections of intro to CS class - experience and no experience
    (due to bias, gaming, etc. boys are more like to have been exposed to
computers and programming than girls before colleague)
  - Choice of programming assignments: robotics, bio, physics - not assuming
    one size fits all
  - Send every female CS undergrad to Grace Hopper conference
* Carnegie Melon
  - 1995 - from 7% to 42% in 5 years
  - Worked with highschools to be more gender neutral
  - Changed admissions policy to favour potential not experience
  - Added an introductory class called computers and the impact on society
  - Little sister, big sister mentoring programme
* William and Mary
  - 24% female undergrads, 50% graduate degrees
* Berkeley - for first time ever more women than men in introductory computer
  science

# Grace Hopper

* 1934 PhD from Yale in Mathematics
* 1931 Teaching Mathematics at Vassar
* 1941 promoted to associated professor
* 1943 joined US Navy Reserve
* 1944 Graduated Naval School and joined Bureau of Ships Computation Project
  at Harvard
* 1947 Moth found in Mark II computer! (although bug had been aroudn for many
  years in engineering)
* 1949 Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation UNIVAC I
* 1952 had an operation compiler "Nobody believed that," she said. "I had a
  running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could
only do arithmetic." 
* 1959 - COBOL - Technical Consultant to CODASYL committee
  - "Hopper's belief that programs should be written in a language that was
    close to English (rather than in machine code or in languages close to
machine code, such as assembly languages) " 
* 1970s - implementation of standrads including FORTRAN and COBOL - eventually
  became NIST
* Retired aged 60 but then came out of retirement continued to work for Navy until 79 - promoted to Rear Admiral
* 79-85 senior consultant for DEC
* "The most important thing I've accomplished, other than building the
  compiler, is training young people. They come to me, you know, and say, 'Do
you think we can do this?' I say, "Try it." And I back 'em up. They need that.
I keep track of them as they get older and I stir 'em up at intervals so they
don't forget to take chances.[30]" 
* "Grace Hopper is famous for her nanoseconds visual aid. People (such as
  generals and admirals) used to ask her why satellite communication took so
long. She started handing out pieces of wire that were just under one foot
long (11.80 inches)â€”the distance that light travels in one nanosecond.

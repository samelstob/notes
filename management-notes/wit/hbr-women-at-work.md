##  Dropping the ball
Tiffiny Dufu

1. Release unrealistic expectations
2. Figured out what matters most to you
3. What your highest and best use is
4. Meaningfully engaged the people in your life to support you in your journey

* What is it that you are striving for and why are you striving for that?
  - It's less about dropping the things that are not as important as it is
    about dropping the things that really don't reflect your highest and best
use.

* Your highest and best use: "What are the things you do extraordinarily well, with little effort, combined
  with what are the things that only you can do (it would be irresponsible to
delegate those things)".  Those are the things you want to hold on to and prioritise.

  - Once you are clear about what you need to be focussed on it's much easier
    to then say - all of this other stuff I can let this go.

  - Not because it's not important but because it's not the most efficient or
    effective strategy for you to achieve your goals.

* "One of the things that only I can do in respect to my kids is to instil
    values.  My highest and best use in raising concious global citizens is in
engaging my kids in meaningful conversations each and every day - I am their
coach in chief."
  "What kind of day did you create for yourself today?  Who did you laugh with
today?"
  - I can drop the ball on making a Halloween costume

* Drop the ball question: Is saying yes to this my highest and best use in
  achieving X, Y, Z
  - There a consequences to dropping the ball but I move on knowing I'm doing
    what I need to do in order to create a life I'm passionate about.

* "White men do not run the world because they picked themselves up by their
  bootstraps and worked hard - they all got help along the way.  I am here
because of the cumulative investment of people have opened many doors for me.
My responsibility as the beneficiary of those kinds of opportunities is to make
sure that not only the people who have supported me but the world gets a
really solid return on their investment."

# GHC 2012 Keynote - Nora Denzel - Are We There Yet?

Three error messages: WHAT?  HOW?  SORRY
Next door neighbour had a TRS-80.  Learnt to write programs to tape 7 times to
ensure got it back once!

Went on to major in CS at college "after finding out they paid you to write
programs" and fell in love with all things computer storage.

Started at IBM as a SWE in their storage division - in storage management
software for the first decade.

"Back in the day moving data around the datacentre was really difficult
because data was mapped to the device gemotery it was on.  We had one class of
data sets called "Unmovable data sets" - customers were saying we had to move
them"

"I was selected as one of the engineers to go talk to customers.  I got to see
the world as we sold these products in 110 countries - I probably went to all
110 except the ones women weren't allowed to travel alone in"

Took an MBA and then went into engineering management because I wanted to make
some of the decisions "Who on earth made the decision to sell it through this
store, or price it that way, or to name it?"  Having an MBA with a technical
undergrad allowed me to participate in those conversations.

Then I became an executive - I was the business line manager in charge of all
the storage management software products for IBM worldwide.  "I only left IBM
because of the weather - they wanted me to relocate to upstate NY - I made a
life decision after my first winter in California"

"That's one career path of many - as many women are in here there are many
paths - you have to decide what makes your heart beat the fastest and go for
that"

"I was invited for two reasons
i) I decided to puruse a career in CS
ii) After all these years I'm *still* in a career in CS"

As a women that's pretty much an anomoly.  Of all the senior technical
leadership women hold only 5% of the roles.

In our field within the first ten years 52% will change professions or drop out of the workforce all together.

Of all the jobs in computing women hold 25%.

80% of consumer spend is either done by or influenced heavily by women.  In
the professional work force women are 57%.

We are not only not there yet it's a revolution in reverse.  A decade ago it was 30% (now 25%) of the jobs and CS degrees women were 36% - now it's down to 18%.

The way we turn this around is to have more women staying in beyond ten years
and we help more women who are like you and attract them into the profession.

## Why is it important?

Gender diverse teams make better decisions - better decisions means better
products which are designed for more people - the economy gets better in our
societies because technology is a proxy for our country being competitive.

If we all decide to recruit one person per year.

## 1. It all starts with your attitude

When I was 5-7 years into my engineering career it just wasn't going the way I
wanted.  I had been taught there was a career path and a career ladder - that
implied linearity - there was upload mobility and some kind of logical
progression - I was contemplating quitting.

I did some reaseach on the most successful people in their field - the number
one thing that they attributed to their success was their attitude.

# Choosing a company to work for - Reputation

* Look at long term reputation
    - Don't be fooled by short term good or bad news e.g. companies get
      judgements for and against them all the time
    - At any given time a company with a good reputation will get bad press
    - e.g. Having IBM on your resume never hurts
    - Difference of 5k in salary - go for the one with the better reputation,
      especially early in your career
    - Big company have training budget, internal network to learn from
    - If you go at 35, you won't know how to be effective - culture shock
    - "At small companies all this energy and chance to do a lot of things, but
      these things are at a smaller scale, so your not learning how big
companies market if you're doing marketing stuff for small company.  When you
go to big company there is an expectation you are going to do it well and they
know how to do it and they are going to teach you how to do it.  Generally
speaking somebody who has spent a year in marketing at a large company may not
have done as much but understands more than someone.
    If you don't know what you're doing in marketing and there is no one there
to teach you you  not going to learn a tonne."
      
* Choose the company with the best reputation - all other things being equal
    - e.g. having Proctor and Gamble on CV was best decision the careers tool
      guy made
* Look for their reputation in the business press
    - Rather than the "social" press
    - Wall street journal, financial times, fortune, hoovers, top one hundred
      companies - they give insight into their methodology

* Look for their local reputation
    - Reach out to your network - less likely to read about this
    - Division and location you will be working for e.g. when a company has
      been bought, there can still be a different atomosphere after it's been
boughtj
    
* Look for their reputation in what you will be doing
    - e.g. disney good reputation for theme parks, bad for disney-pixar
    - long wave thinking - e.g. xbox makes a tonne of money
    - you have to steep yourself in it for a period of time - probably what
      you think you know you don't
    - reptutation for b2b firms
    - e.g. ibm consulting used to not be well regarded
    - got to start paying attention
    - "I know for a fact that if I'd have spent the last 30 years of my life
      saying I worked a Navco not I worked at Proctor and Gamble less doors
would have been opened"
    

# Choosing a Company to Work For - Values

* Choose/explore/examine your values
    - Website
    - e.g. asked to do something illegal
    - What is my definition of lying?
    - Would I tell white 
    - Would I manipulate my fitures to get a bonus
    - Would I pad my expenses
    - Would I say something was done when it wasn't
    - Do you want to work for a boss or a company that would encounrage you to
      do the above
    - Do I feel that the fact that shell makes Â£1.5M in profit per hour is
      morally wrong
    - Do I feel that the only true work is non-profit
    - Do I feel that a company that has a negative effect on the enviornment
      should be made to pay?
    - Do I feel that family is more important than work
    - Do I feel guilty doing overtime if my kids were at home?
    - Do I feel that I should earn as much as I can to give them a better life
      style?
* There is no truth about the future, only opinions.  To intentionally mislead
  someone...
* Values change with the stage of life.

* Pay attention during interview
    - If you interviewer disses people in the interview...
* B2B pay more because they don't have the "street cred"
* Ethical, professional, kind, treat their employees like family members
* Take people out to lunch and see how they treat the waiter
* Come back from the interview, think about the experience you had, assessing
  them is important
* What's it liking working there?  What seems to be important there?
* Comment forums are generally significantly more negative
* Consider asking on linked in
* Consider companies that use manager tools
* 
    
* Large organisations are a natural outcome
* The net of human existence is 60% magnificent and 40% awful
* 
* Decide which ones apply to work
* How to use them
* If you go against your values, your going to be miserable
* The great trajedy of life is not the death and the end, but the thousand
  deaths you life along the way.
* Make sure your values are aligned with your company and a lot of other
  things will be easier along the way

"If you're not a liberal in your twenties you don't have a heart, if you not a
conservative on your 40s you don't have a head"

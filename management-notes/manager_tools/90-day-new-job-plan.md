# 90 Day New Job Plan - Your Role

1. Decide on what your top priority is going to be

  - The moment there are "so many things to do" there is not one clear thing

2. Determine what the rest of your unofficial job description is going to be

  - Not what the company - what you believe are the key things that will make
    a difference

3. Work out what your metrics are

 - If you don't have metrics we recommend that you create them

For executives you have time to really make a difference in one area.  People
think they have skills in lots of areas so they want to apply themselves to
all the places where they think their skills are distinctive.

The dispersion of ones time across a number of areas where one has strengths
is wasteful to the organisation.  One must apply ones self.

Napoleons dictum - mass at the point of decision.

If you win at the point of decision the other points don't matter.

You can't attack at full strength everywhere by definition.

Urgent is necessarily synonymous with important.  Solving the important problem is way
more important in the long term than fire-fighting.

Your priorities have got to be in the realm of your bosses priorities.

Build credibility.

## Work out what your metrics are

Your company whatever it does gets measured.  Any system that is required to
behave differently externally than it behaves internally is doomed some
significant comeuppance or failure.

A house divided against itself cannot stand.

If you don't know your metrics are you have no evidence you are doing a good
job.

One Less Thing
==============

* Look at your calendar for the previous month and delegate the least important
thing
* This relies on the calendar being accurate
* Good executives know where their time is spent

My calendar is not accurate

I'm severly disheartned by what

What can I get rid of?

* Assisting MB
* Meeting with RP
* Meeting with ET
* Man meeting
* Team meeting
* XML meeting
* Publisher meeting
* Out of line meeting
* Parallel loading
* Power issue with baltic
* IO issues on baltic

Things to do

* Make sure people are empowered to look at baltic/antarctic issues
* Don't go to any meetings without agenda?
* Log all time spent on unplanned items
* Reduce the interrupable time allowed
* Find the source of the bonotel mess up
* Do not allow changes to priorities immediately
* Say no
* The timezone thing can't be fixed
* Find out what the business requirements are.

I have spent more time on the least important item and least important person.

Why?  I didn't want my team to be spending time on it and I thought I could
help.

I can't

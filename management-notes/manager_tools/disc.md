# Effective Relationships - I'm a C, my boss is an I

* High I's hate detail and repetitive work
* It's important to understand how other people feel and behave in order
  to understand how best to work with them

# The "D" in DISC

* High Ds expect you to be very quick with bad news.  If you know about bad
  news on Monday and you wait until Wednesday they are going to perceive that
you are hiding - that you are not being forthcoming.
* They can tolerate
someone who misses deadlines as long as you explain why and what you are doing
about it.
  - If the boss says "Where are we on the project?" you can see "We are yellow
    and we are going to be red in two weeks if we don't do this, this and
this.  Here's my plan for doing this, this and this.  Here's the resources I
need from you."  It's not "Gosh boss, I'm really worried, I'm thinking that we
might be red in a coupe of weeks and I'm hoping to get your input and see what
you think and I'm not sure what to do."
  -  We don't care that you don't know what to do.  We are okay with a plan
    that is only 70% certain.  Say "We are behind, I'm responsible, we are
yellow and we are going to become red unless we do this things, and here's my
plan to do these things."
* High D's love people who meet deadlines.  It's okay to be behind as long
  as you let them know - the danger is being behind and not reporting on
it - as if you are not willing to share information about where you are.  If
someone who reports to you is not doing what you expect them to do D's want to
know about it.
* They also want you to be very clear about what their results and their
  responsibilities are.  Asking questions about where are we on X - something
that's important to her.

# Getting Ready To Be Promoted

* Getting promoted is a strategic campaign
* As with any strategic campaign you need allies
* What you look up at the top of your organisations, what you call politics
  those executives call collaboration
* Have to understand the strategic forces at play in order to make your
  tactics work
* The further up the organisation you go the more you get done working with
  other people and the less you get done doing it yourself
* Almost all of us complain about politics when we are young

## Know Why

* More Challenge
* I have more to give
* More Influence

# Foundations Of Presentation Mastery

* 1. Master your content
  - You have to know your content significantly better than almost anyone in
    the audience
  - "A black belt is when you start learning"
  - "It's not what you don't know that kills you, it's what you know for
    sure that isn't true"
  - If you have to look at your slides to know what to say next you have not
    mastered your content
  - If you are completely prepared content wise, behaviour wise, audience
    wise you will win over more of the audience whilst destorying the person
    who asked a bad question
  - You have to understand the underlying principals.  You have to know not
    just what you are going to say, but *why*.  The lack of understanding *why* is often rrevealed through questions
2. Great presentations start and end with the audience
  - The same content presented to two different audiences has to be presented
    differently in order to achieve any reasonable goal
  - Seeing preparation for a presentation as working on your slides is the
    most common behavioural mistake that people make presenting today
  - Consider the audience as individuals.  Communication is what the listener
    does.
  - I have an idea in my head that I want the other person to share in their
    head
  - Idea -> Pictures -> Words -> Hearing -> Translation -> Pictures ->  Idea
  - Asking a question to supplement, translate, or rearrange the information

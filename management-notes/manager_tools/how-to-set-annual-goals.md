# How to set annual goals

MT not a fan of SMART goals.  Focus on M and T

* Specific
* Measurable
* Achievable
* Results Oriented
* Time limited

Sine qua non (an essential condition, a thing that is absolutely necessary)

The useful bits of SMART goals are Measurable and Time bound

The S, A, and R get in the way of the important M and T

* Proxies e.g. measure complaints to get a measure for quality
* Avoid vague words like improve, boost, correct, develop, elevate, enhance,
grow, help, increase, revamp, revive, update, upgrade
* STAY NARROW.  Don't come up with 10 goals, come up with 3 that you will fall
  on your sword for.  Commit your life/career to the 3 big ones.
  - Make sure the 3 are connected to the big levers in your organisation
* "Why spend your time running around when you can spend your time moving
  forward"
* Plan for Q3 completion - give yourself a buffer
* Backwards planning - what are the last things you would do before you call
  the goal done?
* Front load tasks: Don't try to make things equal throughout the year.  Try
  to get everything done by the start of Q4 - gives you room for curve balls.
Do backward planning - accelerate stuff in Jan

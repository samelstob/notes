# Leading By Speaking - Lara Hogan

1. What do you want to say

Getting a solid structure for your content is the best way to guide your
auidence through your topic.

Structure helps set expectations fro what's next, helps strengthen your
arguments, and helps give you that foothold if you lost your train of thought

2. Set expectations

Why are you there?  Why is it important to you or them?  What do you hope they
will walk away with?

## Give yourself some structure

e.g. story, a thesis statement backed up by arguments

Example structure:

1. Landscape - about this topic, here is what exists
2. Analysis - here is what I see about that landscape
3. Problem - at the core is this issue
4. Options - here are some options about what we could do - and I like to
   include some terrible options that way I can really point out
5. Solutions here is the best option and how it works
6. Reason - Here's why you should believe me
7. Bigger idea - things that may not be of interest to your audience but you
   want to cover anyway

## Keep 'em engaged

Don't feel you need to tell jokes or use internet memes - be authentic, be yourself.  Do identify dry parts of the
talk and keep them engaged - e.g. tell a story of something that went wrong
(icon font that led to horses head being shown to all Etsy users)

Delight yourself - it can be private - add a post-it note or picture to your
laptop to make you smile or it could be woven in to your narrative structure
"I am better speaker when there is something in my talk that makes me feel
really good"

### Don't distract your audience

Triple check that any images or quotes you use are as inclusive as possible
and won't offend or distract anybody.

## Practice & Get Feedback

Let's get better at giving and receiving feedback.

* Pick your feedback crew - don't just pick people that will give positive
  feedback
* Pick your feedback medium - e.g. consider recording and sending the
  recording to get feedback via email to separate the activities of practice
and  receiving feedback
* As your practice watch how people respond
* Prime your feedback crew
  - Is this too complex?
  - Does my argument hold?
  - Am I speaking too fast?
  - Did I make sense?
* Practice surviving a fumble
  - There's a part of us that wants to wallow for a minute when we mess up -
    to settle into that defeated feeling - but you can't get stuck there -
 you've got to push on through.  Practice making mistakes and recovering from
them - work on reducing that fear of messing up by getting to the end a bunch
of times.  If you are able to work through a mistake in the practice run you
will have confidence you can do it again once you are in that spotlight.

* Good feedback is specific and actionable
  - Hearts - positive but not actionable
  - Diamond - positive and actionable
  - Club - negative and not actionable
  - Spade - negative but actionable - "my mind started to wander when you
    described the technical changes - can you include screenshots or other
visuals to help keep the audiences attention"

## Practice Answering Questions

I'm afraid of...

You can say "I don't know" out loud.  No matter how much of an expert you are
there will always be questions you are not prepared for.  "That's interesting
I haven't thought about that before".  "Who else knows the answer to that
question - can you go and talk that person afterewards"

* You're still in control during Q&A

* As your feedback crew to ask tough questions: creative ways people could
  misunderstand your point, go on complete tangents, or give incorrect
information, or bring up those terrible arguments that go nowhere like isn't X
better than Y (this is usulaly the most fun part for your feedback crew)

## Prep Your Environment

* Wear what makes you feel like a superhero
* Back up everything - have slides on cloud and USB!
* Power pose 
* Breath a sigh of relief

"Talks don't define you; you define you.  Talks come and go, but every single
one will make you a better you"
* Celebrate your achievement - take the time to note your own success - be deliberate
  - Make sure you are acknolwedgein to yousrself the huge accomplishment of
    syaing some prepared words under a spotlight

# Bigger Idea

* We need a broader spectrum of voices to move forward as an industry
* Share your work and your knowledge
* Help others share their work and their knowledge

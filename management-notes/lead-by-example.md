Management notes
================

Lead by example
---------------

Make sure as a manager you lead by example - if you demand time tracking of
people you need to do it yourself.  If you demand design docs, automated
tests, updating release notes you need to do it yourself too.

Don't have to solve all problems.  True, in a small company there are still
many things that could be improved.  At least there is the potential for them
to be changed.  In a larger company things don't work and you may feel
powerless to change them


Human Task Switches Considered Harmful
--------------------------------------
From Joel

* Multi tasking means that individual tasks on average take longer to complete
* Programmers take a long time to task switch because they have to hold a lot 
  of things in their head to really get the job done
* never let people work on more than one thing at once
* Good managers see their responsibility as removing obstacles so that people 
  can focus on one thing and really get it done
* When emergencies come up, think about whether you can handle it yourself 
  before you delegate it to a programmer who is deeply submersed in a project

Hitting the high notes
----------------------

* Five Antonio Salieris won't produce Mozart's Requiem. Ever. Not if they work 
  for 100 years.
* It's not just a matter of "10 times more productive." It's that the "average 
  productive" developer never hits the high notes that make great software.

Lord Palmerston on Programming
------------------------------

* Leaky abstractions mean that we live with a hockey stick learning curve: you 
  can learn 90% of what you use day by day with a week of learning. But the 
  other 10% might take you a couple of years catching up. That's where the 
  really experienced programmers will shine
* it's OK to have a lot of less experienced programmers cranking out big 
  blocks of code using the abstract tools, but the team is not going to work 
  if you don't have some really experienced members to do the really hard 
  stuff.
* There are a lot of programming worlds, each of which requires a tremendous 
  amount of knowledge for real proficiency.
* You might think that basic programming, say, your expert C++ skills, are the 
  90% and all the APIs are the 10% fluff you can catch up on in a few weeks.  
  To these people I humbly suggest: times have changed. The ratio has 
  reversed.
* Very few people get to work on low level C algorithms that just move bytes 
  around any more. Most of us spend all our time these days calling APIs, not 
  moving bytes. 
* People who only know one world get really smarmy, and every time they hear 
  about the complications in the other world, it makes them think that their 
  world doesn't have complications. But they do. You've just moved beyond them 
  because you are proficient in them. 
* The software worlds are so huge and complicated and multifaceted that when I 
  see otherwise intelligent people writing blog entries saying something 
  vacuous like "Microsoft is bad at operating systems," frankly, they just 
  look dumb.
* big handwavy generalizations made from a position of deep ignorance is one 
  of the biggest wastes of time on the net today.

* Which is better, XUL, Eclipse's SWT, or wxWindows? I don't know. They are 
  all such huge worlds that I couldn't really evaluate them and tell. It's not 
  enough to read the tutorials. You have to sweat and bleed with the thing for 
  a year or two before you really know it's good enough or realize that no 
  matter how hard you try you can't make your UI taste like real food.

* So for now, my advice is this: don't start a new project without at least 
  one architect with several years of solid experience in the language, 
  lasses, APIs, and platforms you're building on. I

The Update, The Vent, and The Disaster

"The cliché is “People are your most valuable resource”. I would argue they 
are your only resource. Computers, desks, building, data centers… Whatever.  
All of those other tools only support your one and only resource: your 
people."

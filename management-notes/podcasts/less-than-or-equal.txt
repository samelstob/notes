# 90. Sonya Green - Passionate about customer support

* Good customer support can be an opportunity to get UX input, feature 
  requests, customer retention
* There are other jobs that are incredibly important in a product succeeding 
  besides coding 
* Not wanting to "parent" people in their mid 20's
* Narrative of "If all women would learn to code then we would solve this".  
  Easier when the narrative is clear.  "All women are capable of coding.  We 
  just didn't have a chance and now we will and then it will be fine - but 
  it's far more complicated than that."
* "Saying I don't want to code makes me feel bad"
* Diversity in tech: We are in the talking stage not the doing stage
* Customer support key skills: Empathy, Communication, Problem Solving
* Apple are releasing diversity numbers - this is not changing fast enough.
* Pipeline problem does exist
* Check your privilege
* "I feel that people are being more introspective and more willing to change 
  their behaviours"
* "Kind of shocked how great being in my 30's is"

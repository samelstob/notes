# What Tech Can Do About Homelessness (Dan Lurie, CEO, Tipping Point)

* Robin Hood organisation - Stan Drucker Miller
* Tipping Point - A few passionate people can make great change
* Ronnie Lott - "You you need a little star power" XXXSE Fearless Change
* Tipping Point - June 2005.  100% impact, connect not-for-profit with best of
  business world, metrics, accountability, help them measure their results,
proove and improve
* 15000 non-profits, strong leadership, clean financials, a willingness to
  measure and hold themselves accountable, a willingness to engage with an
organisation like ours.  "The time for good intentions is over - we need
tangible results - we are talking about people's lives - we are talking about
1.3M people who are too poor to meet their basic needs in the home of all of
these amazing companies - it's unacceptable"
* Four issue areas:
  - Education - 45%
  - Housing
  - Employment
  - Health (0-5yrs) 
* "If you have a child who is going to a failing school - they're in trouble.
  If they're going to a good school you are taking care of 7:30-5 but if they
are going home and their sleeping in their car, or their mum and dad doesn't
have a living wage job, or if they don't have access to healthcare that child
is going to struggle and not make it.  Safe housing, living wage, access to
healthcare." 
* "We need to do better by a lot of people"
* 8000-10000 homeless in a given night, 1700 chronic homeless.  They cost
  $80k per year.  If you house them it costs $20k/year.  We think the city is
spending $500M-$600M/year on homelessness.
* "Every person in this city should commit to helping solve this issue"

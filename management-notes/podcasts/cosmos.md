* Newton claimed to have already solved the maths explaining gravity and why
  planets travel in an ellipse when Halley went to see him.  Allegedly his
experience with Hooke taking credit for his work previously had made him a
recluse and put him off sharing his work!

* Evolution can only develop in small increments, each one has to be valuable
  - hey evolution is a form of agile development!

* Our eyes evolved to see underwater.  Since we moved to the land and needed to
  see in air they have never been able to see as well as they could when we
were underwater.  Evolution can't wipe the slate clean and start again - it
can only make small increments from what already exists.

* Newton needed a manager!  He needed someone to recognise the importance of
  his work and share it with the world.

* People weren't so pigeon-holed as they are now - e.g. Sir Christopher Wren
  was a scientist and architect

* They are all wealthy white men - what if society had enabled people of any
  background to succeed like this - what might we have achieved by now? 

* Our brains have evolved for pattern matching - visualisation!

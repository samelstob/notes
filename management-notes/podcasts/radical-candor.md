# Ep 4: Ruinous Empathy and Criticism

* The purpose of criticism is to help people know what to do better.
* Your real role as a leader is to help people grow and you can't help them
  grow if you don't tell them what they are doing wrong
* People *are* going to take criticism personally.  Don't try to prevent tears
  - handle it compassionately - pick the conversation about 15 minutes later or
    the next day
* Look for a teachable moment
* Don't tell somebody not to be sad - people feel the way the feel.  It is not
  your job as a manager to control other peoples feelings (which you can't do
anyway)
* Much better for the person to know what they are doing wrong even if it's
  short term upsetting.
* If you want people to have more success you've got to help them know what to
  do better.  Sometimes when you deliver criticism they are going to get
upset.  What matters is how you react to it - not trying to avoid it.
* It's an act of kindness to tell them how to do better

1. Just say it

That work is not good enough.  That behaviour is not working.

2. Go into a criticism conversation with both the criticism and the objectives
   for the meeting written down

Objectives - I just want to be helpful - help them get better

- Practice - sharpen your message.
Sometimes things seem so clear in your head and then you start talking to
someone else and you realise you've got a way to go

3. Accept the fact that you may not have a solution to offer right in the
   moment.  Consider asking the person on finding solutions.

- Feel like you shouldn't give criticism if you don't have the solution in
  hand ready to go
- If something is not working it is complicated why
- Your version of why it's not working may not be totally correct

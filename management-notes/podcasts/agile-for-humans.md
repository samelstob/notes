# Software Estimation with Steve McConnell
5/5

## NoEstimates

* Conversation with Ron Jeffries
* "17 thesis on software estimation"
* Customer collaboration is a founding principal of agile.  The customers we
  work with, by and large, value estimates.  They use them for legitmate
business planning purposes.
* "I thought there some unexamined assumptions behind no estimates"
* In the early days of agile some people were justifying it on a false premise
  - that it's impossible to get good requirements.  I disagreed with that.
  - It's impossible to get perfect requirements
  - It's impossible to 
  - It's impossible to get good requirements if you don't have well developed
    requirements skills which the vast majority of software practicioners
don't have.  As an empirical observation we often get bad requirements
  - I was enthusiastic about the agile practices but not the rationale being
    used at the time to support those.  Fast fowrad 10 years and we see
similar arguments being made in the case of #noestimates
  - If you don't know what you are doing it is difficult to get good estimates
    - that is true.  As an empirical observation lots of people produce bad
      estimates - that is also true.
    - I don't think the most useful response is to throw out the attempt to
      get good estimates.  I think the most useful response is "develop the
professional skills that are needed to create good estimates so we are coming
at the problem from a position of confidence and strength"

## Estimates versus forecasts

* The lack of a basic understanding of software estimation.
* The idea that estimates and forecasts are different doesn't understand what
  estimation is.
  - A forecasts is a specific kind of estimate - an estimate of some future
    occurence.
  - Not all estimates are about the future - if I go out and estimate the size
    of a crowd at some political event or I estimate the number of square feet
in an existing house there is no forecasting there it's purely estimating
something that already exists.
  - In software, for the most part, we are in fact talking about the specific
    kind of estimation known as forecasting becuase we are talking about
estimating some future occurrence.  The idea that there is some distinction in
software between forecasting and estimation doesn't start with a basic
understanding of what the words mean.
  - The fact that someone presents best cast, worst case, expected case
    doesn't mean that actually had any skill going in to those.  They can still be
sticking their finger in the air and applying their gut feel.  At that level
we are still really talking about guessing.
  - These should be backed by more serious analysis and appeal to historical
    data.

## #noestimate versus estimates

* This idea of people estimating badly and then causing all kinds of
  organisational turmoil as a result of that is not a new idea - that's been
something that's been going on the entire time software has existed
* A lot of people have being looking at this topic for a long time and it
  would probably be beneficial for people to actually take a look at what's
already been done and not feel like they have to reinvent the wheel.

* We have a tendency in software on all sides of any issue to compare poorly
  informed unskilled application of the point of view that we don't like with
well informed competent application of the point of view that we do like
  - This is a fallacious comparison
  - What possibilities do we open up when we have competency in estimation.
    What possibilities do we open up when we have comptency in an
implementation approach like scrum.
  - I don't think it makes sense to compare competent scrum to incompetent
    estimation.
  - What we really ought to be doing and what has been my focus for the last
    25 years has been trying to increase the professionalism of people working
as software professionals.
  - It's not the centre of our job but it's an important secondary skill.  A
    true professional is going to try to develop some competence in both those
primary skill areas and those secondary skill areas.
  - Some technical people tend to use their necessary areas of expertise as
    coding, designing testing.  I do think some of these other skills end up
mattering or affecting peoples lives just as much or on some cases more.

## Competent estimation - budgeting context

* Budgeting context
  - Organisation has a list of 20 projects that it would like to take on, but
    it has a budget for maybe 10 of those projects
  - Somebody is going to have to come up with a business case that says we
    think this project is worth doing, we think the benefit is going to
outweigh the cost.  This is going to involve estimation of the benefit it's
also going to involve estimation of the cost
  - We don't live in a world where every idea is a good idea and we actually
    have the resoureces to do every idea that anybody ever comes up with.  We
have to choose.  That's an important planning function of any business.
  - Before the project even starts there is a need to come up with an estimate
    for the project.  The business has a legitmate need to com eup with an
estimate for the project.
* This estimate does not need to involve individuals on the scrum team -
  that's the wrong kind of estimation practice too early in the project.
  - The scrum team may not even exist at this point

## Initial estimates and Anchoring effect

* "An early estimate, no matter how poorly founded, becomes an anchor against
  which every estimate throughout the rest of the project gets compared"
* A lot of organisations have ineffective commitment processes.
  - It can be pretty hard to get rid of that initial estimate even though
    later we have a much better estimate.
  - Most large mature organisations have some kind of defined stage-gate
    process if it's used well can be supportive of effective estimation and
an effective commitment process
  - We see cases where people don't know how to work their own organisations
    stage-gate process effectively.  In an organisation where the staff
understand how to use their stage-gate process their doesn't have to be a lot
of turmoil

## Project Approval Process

* Coarse grained decision making
  - Should we start this project now or should we start it six months from now
  - How does it fit into our priority queue
  - How many should we put on the project
* Once the project finally hits that gate where the funding has been approved
  and the project official gets authorized the role of estimation really
changes significantly at that point
* Now the role estimation is more inward looking.  It's for the team to manage
  itself.  It's for the team to assess how it's progress is going and whether
the progress is going according to plan.
* If a gap opens up between the original estimates and the re-estimates on the
  ground then we have to go back and tell the project sponsors - overrunning
the budget, overrunning the schedule or under running the functionality 
* If the scrum team is calculating velocity, having a release burndown - once
  the team is performing effectively as a team we have a pretty good ability
to create a longer range forecast of when we are going to be done.
  - Forecast, project, estimate - they all mean the same thing in this context
* Bad news delivered early is always better than bad news delivered late

## Changes to estimates

* If there is an initial anchor of 75 staff-months and then some more work was
  done and it really looks like the answer is ore like 125 staff months.  What
happened to not get that 125 staff-months re-estimate accepted
* One factor can be the business doesn't have a good commitment process.  The
  business may have already committed on the basis of that very premature
estimate - that is a problem that needs to be addressed at the business level.
* They shouldn't have been presenting such a precise number - a range or a
  coarser number - e.g. At this point we think it's about 10 staff-years
* Technical staff have a personality flaw in which they expect the business to
  be happy and cooperative when the business receives bad news. We cannot
realistically expect the business to be happy about receiving bad news.  We
can expect the business to probe and question and try to problem solve to get
back to what they thought they were going to get.  That's a natural, healthy
process.  If the business just rolled over and said "yeah that's fine we just
increased by 50 staff-months" I don't think the business is doing it's job if
it does that.
* Part of the businesses job is to try to figure out how to get the work done
  for a cost that makes sense

## Estimates, targets, and commitments

* "If the commitment is for cost, schedule and functionality our estimate is
  telling you we have got early notice that we are not going to deliver on
that commitment."
* If the commitment was for schedule and cost but not details of functionality we can
  pair down the functionality.

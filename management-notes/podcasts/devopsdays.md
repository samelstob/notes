# Eric Passmore - 5min ignite - Stop doing FMA & Start doing Checklists 

FMA - Failure Mode Analysis

1. Review entire system
2. Brainstorming possible failures
3. Score the failures (Impact X Frequency)
4. Separate
  - Big Issues from
  - Minor annoyances

Failure mode analysis doesn't really work because of
1. Pride - Difficult to critique your own software
2. Extra Homework
  - SHould really do it in design time
  - Teams want to develop today
  - Fix bugs during "stabilization"
3. Trust
  - Teams suspect managers use failure modes as an evaluation of their
    abilities

* Checklists
  * Used in Aviation and Medicine - places that have life and death
    consequences

* Specifics Drive Leraning
* Explicit Standards - Writing Things Down Works

## Tone from the Top

* Tone from the top matters
* Progress not perfection
* Team's need to own, adopt, and modify the checklist

Argh with these google apis, jquery, and javascript we could do so much in
javascript rather than in java

for example we could return the data in a raw form to the browser (JSON) and
use google visualisation apis

Using javascript rather than server

Pros

* Data can be interactive
- well actually with ajax you could do pretty much everything on the server
  that you could do in javascript the difference is that it would be faster to
do it on the client
- ajax can be slow - you need the servers to respond fast

Cons

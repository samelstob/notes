* There will be a day when you can no longer do this.
Today is NOT that day.
* The universe is 99% bullshit
* What is the business requirement?
* DONE "We're far from "done" but I believe we're already significantly ahead 
  of most other date/time APIs I've seen in terms of providing a clean API 
  which reduces *incidental* complexity while highlighting the *inherent* 
  complexity of the domain."
* DONE "Composition is the key to controlling complexity in software.  In The 
  Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Abelson and Sussman argue 
  that composition beautifully expresses complex systems from simple patterns.

    In our study of program design, we have seen that expert programmers 
    control the complexity of their designs with the same general techniques 
    used by designers of all complex systems. They combine primitive elements 
    to form compound objects, they abstract compound objects to form 
    higher-level building blocks, and they preserve modularity by adopting 
    appropriate large-scale views of system structure.

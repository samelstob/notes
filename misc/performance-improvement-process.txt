Performance improvement process

1. Identify where the time is spent
2. Don't do it
3. If you need to do it, do less of it
3.5 Are you treating it all the same, when it would be better to split "it"
  and treat bits differently - access patterns, types of data
4. If you can't do any less of it, change a third party component to do it
   more efficiently (e.g. gzip library, Oracle 11 compression)

Things I like
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Assigning bugs to people when I know it will make product better and they
  will do a good job
* Explaining things to people
* Getting concensus

Things I dislike
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Arbrtrating heated discussions when one person is labouring a point
* Not having control over things
- meetings overruning
- when to stop discussing a point

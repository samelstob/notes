==== Catastrophising ====

If I take this job then I'll end up really stressed, tired, hating my job, 
losing friends, arguing with Sam, becoming a nob, not knowing how to program, 
becoming dumber.

If I don't take this job I'll be shying away, weak, immature, scaredy cat.

Consider less terrifying explanations::

Most people would find this situation scary and daunting.  Probably most 
programmers actually go through the same thing at the same sort of time in 
their career.  Why not talk to Jim.

It is without doubt a more difficult choice than many others in your career 
path.  Dad said that the reality is that few people can progress their career  
purely on their technical ability.  Some level of management is inevitable 
with career progression.

I want to be a team leader instead though.

a. That's not on the table
b. You could consider asking although Rich specifically said he didn't want 
you to be a team lead.

==== All or Nothing ====

Be realistic

If you did choose this, it doesn't actually prevent you from ever programming 
again.  If even if it *did* end taking up all your time, stressing you out, 
making you miserable and regretting it; you *can* leave.  It's not a prison 
sentence.

If you were doing no programming at work you could choose to do some in your 
spare time.  For example, you could work on an open source project or just try 
out things your interested in.  Programming might actually be *more* fun 
because you don't *have* to finish anything!

At the moment I'm trying to finish this bloody categorisation/extraction gui 
and not getting the blocks of time clear to work on it.

Both - And reasoning

I can both do the job of development manager and not have to never code again.  
And the money might be nice!

If you want you could set yourself a time limit.  Give yourself two years to 
see if you enjoy it.  If you really don't after two years then move on.

Some of the positives:

. Might be able to introduce some of the things that interest me in process 
  improvement
.. Code reviews
.. Practice sessions
.. Static analysis
.. Continuous integration
.. Automated testing

==== Fortune-telling ====

You don't *really* know what a job is like until you do it.  I didn't think 
*this* job, which I'm now worried about 'losing' would be any good at first.

==== Mind-reading ====

Yanxin doesn't respect me so this wouldn't work.

Sure, she disagrees with you on some things.  You can be patronising, 
argumentative and stubbon sometimes.  This isn't the end of the world.  No 
manager gets on equally well with everyone.

==== Emotional Reasoning ====

What if it doesn't 'feel' like the right move.

Well, it's not entirely clear how useful gut feelings are for this kind of 
thing. Anyway gut feelings are not a one-to-one relationship with thoughts and 
feelings.


In an ideal world I would have a like to work on bigger projects before doing 
this.  In the real world I may do this and then work on bigger projects!


I guess part of me feels I have invested an enormous amount of time in 
becoming a good programmer and now my reward is - not doing any programming.  
The reality is though this *is* how good programmers are most often rewarded.  
And your statements from before still hold; you don't *have* to do it for ever 
and it's still a very good experience and career move if you don't.

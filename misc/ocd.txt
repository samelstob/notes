Identifying that OCD feeling

- A feeling that I'm ignoring something that I should be concerned about or 
  I've forgotten to worry about something - a bit like if you've feel you may 
  have left the hair straighteners on or you worry if you may have run over 
  someone when driving home
- That it's irresponsible to ignore it
- A desire to get that 'right' feeling about the above before you can continue

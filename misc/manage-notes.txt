Meetings
~~~~~~~~

* Good when everyone there needs to talk to everyone else there - more
* efficient
* Good for when something should be arrived at by concensus
* Good for discussing contentious issues
* Don't call a meeting just for the sake of it.  Don't feel afraid to cancel
  or decline a meeting
* Agree actions during the meeting not afterwards
* Write up minutes as soon as possible

Recruiting
~~~~~~~~~~

* Recruiting is expensive.  Recruiting the wrong person is VERY expensive.
* Even if you can't find the right person don't be tempted to hire someone who
  isn't right.
* Spend time with them on first day
* If you know they are wrong candidate then draw interview to a close
* Ask everyone same test
* Recruiting is not just about getting someone in.  It's about getting someone
  in who will do a good job and stay for some time
* Consider showing good candidates round
* Let them do as much talking as possible, else you won't learn much about
  them.
* Be organised - candidates will judge you as representitive of the
  organisation
* Don't be scared to ask hard questions.  Better people like being asked
  harder questions because it gives them a chance to stand out from the crowd.
* Consider asking developers to write some code
